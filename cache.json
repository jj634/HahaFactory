Mr. Otoma is suing the bar and the brewery for selling toxic substances and is claiming damages for grievous bodily harm leading to the loss of his job. The bar is counter suing for defamation and loss of customers.\n\nThe Asaka Beer Corporation brews \"Suiso\" brand beer, where the carbon dioxide normally used to add fizz has been replaced by the more environmentally friendly hydrogen gas. A side effect of this has made the beer extremely popular at karaoke sing-along bars and discotheques. Hydrogen, like helium, is a gas lighter than air. Because hydrogen molecules are lighter than air, sound waves are transmitted more rapidly; individuals whose lungs are filled with the nontoxic gas can speak with an uncharacteristically high voice. Exploiting this quirk of physics, chic urbanites can now sing soprano parts on karaoke sing-along machines after consuming a big gulp of Suiso beer. The flammable nature of hydrogen has also become another selling point, even though Asaka has not acknowledged that this was a deliberate marketing ploy. It has inspired a new fashion of blowing flames from one's mouth using a cigarette as an ignition source. Many new karaoke videos feature singers shooting blue flames in slow motion, while flame contests take place in pubs everywhere.\n\n\n\"Mr. Otoma has no-one to blame but himself. If he had not become drunk and disorderly, none of this would have happened. Our security guards undergo the most careful screening and training before they are allowed to deal with customers\" said Mr. Takashi Nomura, Manager of the Tike-Take Bar. \"Mr. Otoma drank fifteen bottles of hydrogen beer in order to maximize the size of the flames he could belch during the contest. He catapulted balls of fire across the room that Gojira would be proud of, but this was not enough to win him first prize since the judgement is made on the quality of the flames and that of the singing, and after fifteen bottles of lager he was badly out of tune.\"\n\n\n\"He took exception to the result and hurled blue fireballs at the judge, singeing the front of Mrs. Mifune's hair, entirely removing her eyebrows and lashes, and ruining the clothes of two nearby customers. None of these people have returned to my bar. When our security staff approached he turned his attentions to them, making it almost impossible to approach him. Our head bouncer had no choice but to hurl himself at Mr. Otoma's knees, knocking his legs from under him. The laws of physics are not to be disobeyed, and the force that propelled Mr. Otoma's legs backwards also pivoted around his center of gravity and moved his upper body forward with equal velocity. It was his own fault he had his mouth open for the next belch, his own fault he held a lighted cigarette in front of it and it is own fault he swallowed that cigarette.\"\n\n\n\"The Tike-Take bar takes no responsibility for the subsequent internal combustion, rupture of his stomach lining, nor the third degree burns to his esophagus, larynx and sinuses as the exploding gases forced their way out of his body. His consequential muteness and loss of employment are his own fault.\" Mr. Otoma was unavailable for comment.", "categories": ["Bar Jokes"], "score": "3.4621", "maturity": "1", "size": "574", "similarity": "0.3637764252640949", "cos_score": "0.06377642526409491", "jac_score": "0.3", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Ever stop to think...and forget to start again?

We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2001 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.ESCAPEE.Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.COURTESY FLUSH.Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.WALK OF SHAME.Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.SAFE HAVENS.Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.TURD BURGLAR:Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.CAMO-COUGH.Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.ASTAIRE.Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.WATERMELON.Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.HAVANA OMELET.Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.UNCLE TED.Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.FLY BY.Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.", "categories": ["Bar Jokes"], "score": "3.2028", "maturity": "1", "size": "812", "similarity": "0.3", "cos_score": "0.0", "jac_score": "0.3", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "There were these three texans and they were gonna go to mexico to get drunk.

Though still in great shape from when I was on the varsity chess team in high school, I decided it was a good idea to go ahead and try it.\n\nI called and made reservations with someone named Tanya, who said she is a 26-year-old aerobics instructor and athletic clothing model. My wife seemed very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get started.\n\nDay 1\nThey suggest I keep this \"exercise diary\" to chart my progress this\nweek.\n\nStarted the morning at 6:00 AM. Tough to get up, but worth it when I arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me. She's something of a goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile. She showed  me the machines and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She seemed a little alarmed that it\nwas so high, but I think just standing next to her in that outfit of hers added ten points.\n\nEnjoyed watching the aerobics class. Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though my gut was already aching a little from holding it in the whole time I was talking to her. This is going to be GREAT!\n\nDay 2\nTook a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it. Tanya had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the air. Then she put weights on it, for heaven's sake! Legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made it the full mile. Her smile made it all worth it. Muscles\nfeel GREAT!!\n\nDay 3\nThe only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the tooth brush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I am certain that I have developed a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was okay as long as I didn't try to steer. I parked on top of a Volkswagen.\nTanya was a little impatient with me and said my screaming was bothering the other club members. The treadmill hurt my chest so I did the stair monster. Why would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by the invention of elevators? Tanya told me regular exercise would make me\nlive longer. I can't imagine anything worse.\n\nDay 4\nTanya was waiting for me with her vampire teeth in a full snarl. I can't help it if I was half an hour late, it took me that long just to tie my shoes. She wanted me to lift dumbbells. Not a chance, Tanya. The word \"dumb\" must be in there for a reason. I hid in the men's room until she sent Lars looking\nfor me. As punishment she made me try the rowing machine. It sank.\n\nDay 5\nI hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. If there was any part of my body not in extreme pain I would hit her with it. She thought it would be a good idea to work on my triceps. Well I have news for you Tanya, I don't have triceps. And if\nyou don't want dents in the floor don't hand me any barbells.\n\nI refuse to accept responsibility for the damage, YOU went to sadist school, YOU are to blame. The treadmill flung me back into a science teacher, which hurt like crazy.

Mr. Otoma is suing the bar and the brewery for selling toxic substances and is claiming damages for grievous bodily harm leading to the loss of his job. The bar is counter suing for defamation and loss of customers.\n\nThe Asaka Beer Corporation brews \"Suiso\" brand beer, where the carbon dioxide normally used to add fizz has been replaced by the more environmentally friendly hydrogen gas. A side effect of this has made the beer extremely popular at karaoke sing-along bars and discotheques. Hydrogen, like helium, is a gas lighter than air. Because hydrogen molecules are lighter than air, sound waves are transmitted more rapidly; individuals whose lungs are filled with the nontoxic gas can speak with an uncharacteristically high voice. Exploiting this quirk of physics, chic urbanites can now sing soprano parts on karaoke sing-along machines after consuming a big gulp of Suiso beer. The flammable nature of hydrogen has also become another selling point, even though Asaka has not acknowledged that this was a deliberate marketing ploy. It has inspired a new fashion of blowing flames from one's mouth using a cigarette as an ignition source. Many new karaoke videos feature singers shooting blue flames in slow motion, while flame contests take place in pubs everywhere.\n\n\n\"Mr. Otoma has no-one to blame but himself. If he had not become drunk and disorderly, none of this would have happened. Our security guards undergo the most careful screening and training before they are allowed to deal with customers\" said Mr. Takashi Nomura, Manager of the Tike-Take Bar. \"Mr. Otoma drank fifteen bottles of hydrogen beer in order to maximize the size of the flames he could belch during the contest. He catapulted balls of fire across the room that Gojira would be proud of, but this was not enough to win him first prize since the judgement is made on the quality of the flames and that of the singing, and after fifteen bottles of lager he was badly out of tune.\"\n\n\n\"He took exception to the result and hurled blue fireballs at the judge, singeing the front of Mrs. Mifune's hair, entirely removing her eyebrows and lashes, and ruining the clothes of two nearby customers. None of these people have returned to my bar. When our security staff approached he turned his attentions to them, making it almost impossible to approach him. Our head bouncer had no choice but to hurl himself at Mr. Otoma's knees, knocking his legs from under him. The laws of physics are not to be disobeyed, and the force that propelled Mr. Otoma's legs backwards also pivoted around his center of gravity and moved his upper body forward with equal velocity. It was his own fault he had his mouth open for the next belch, his own fault he held a lighted cigarette in front of it and it is own fault he swallowed that cigarette.\"\n\n\n\"The Tike-Take bar takes no responsibility for the subsequent internal combustion, rupture of his stomach lining, nor the third degree burns to his esophagus, larynx and sinuses as the exploding gases forced their way out of his body. His consequential muteness and loss of employment are his own fault.\" Mr. Otoma was unavailable for comment.", "categories": ["Bar Jokes"], "score": "3.4621", "maturity": "1", "size": "574", "similarity": "0.34100870075685663", "cos_score": "0.04100870075685662", "jac_score": "0.3", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Ever stop to think...and forget to start again?

We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2001 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.ESCAPEE.Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.COURTESY FLUSH.Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.WALK OF SHAME.Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.SAFE HAVENS.Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.TURD BURGLAR:Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.CAMO-COUGH.Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.ASTAIRE.Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.WATERMELON.Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.HAVANA OMELET.Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.UNCLE TED.Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.FLY BY.Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.", "categories": ["Bar Jokes"], "score": "3.2028", "maturity": "1", "size": "812", "similarity": "0.32620687295499534", "cos_score": "0.026206872954995335", "jac_score": "0.3", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "A guy walks into a bar and says to the bartender, \"I want you to give me 12-year scotch, and don't try to fool me because I can tell the difference.\"The bartender is skeptical and decides to try to trick the man with 5-year scotch.

(Note: This only works when you have done absolutely nothing wrong.)\n\n\nLet the humans teach you a brand new trick.  Learn it perfectly. Then the humans try to demonstrate it to someone else, stare blankly back at the humans.  Pretend you have no idea what they're talking about.\n\n\nMake your humans be patient.  When you go outside to go 'pee', sniff around the entire yard as your humans wait. Act as if the spot you choose to go pee will ultimately decide the fate of the earth.\n\n\nDraw attention to the human.  When out for a walk always pick the busiest, most visible spot to go 'poo'.  Take your time and make sure everyone watches. This works particularly well if your humans have forgotten to bring a plastic bag.\n\n\nWhen out for a walk, alternate between choking and coughing every time a strange human walks by.\n\n\nMake your own rules.  Don't always bring back the stick when playing fetch with the humans.  Make them go and chase it once in a while.\n\n\nHide from your humans.  When your humans come home, don't greet them at the door.  Instead, hide from them, and make\nthem think something terrible has happened to you.  (Don't reappear until one of your humans is panic-stricken and close to tears).\n\n\nWhen your human calls you to come back in, always take your time. Walk as slowly as possible back to the door.\n\n\nWake up twenty minutes before the alarm clock is set to go off and make the humans take you out for your morning\npee.  As soon as you get back inside, fall asleep.  (Humans can rarely fall back asleep after going outside, this will\ndrive them nuts!)", "categories": ["Animals"], "score": "3.1163", "maturity": "None", "size": "367", "similarity": "0.04864271324076774", "cos_score": "0.04864271324076774", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Top Signs You Have A Drinking Problem\n\n1 You lose arguments with inanimate\nobjects.\n2 You have to hold onto the lawn to keep\nfrom falling off the earth\n3 Job interfering with your drinking.\n4 Your doctor finds traces of blood in\nyour alcohol stream.\n5 Career won't progress beyond Senator\nfrom Massachusettes.\n6 The back of your head keeps getting hit\nby the toilet seat.\n7 Sincerely believe alcohol to be the\nelusive 5th food group.\n8 24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case -\ncoincidence?? - I think not!\n9 Two hands and just one mouth... - now\nTHAT'S a drinking problem!\n10 \"Norm!\" is what they say when you\nenter the bar.\n11 When you can focus better with one eye\nclosed\n12 The parking lot seems to have moved\nwhile you were in the bar\n13 Every woman you see has an exact twin.\n14 You wake up to find Windows 95\ninstalled on your machine.\n15 If you keep asking your wife \"where\nare the kids?\", but you don't really have\na wife and you're talking to the\nrefridgerator.\n16 You fall off the floor.\n17 You discover in the morning liquid\ncleaning supplies have disappeared.\n18 Your twin sons are named Barley and\nHops.\n19 Had \"Spuds McKenzie\" tattoo removed,\nreplaced it with \"Red Dog.\"\n20 Hey, 5 beers has just as many calories\nas a burger, screw dinner!\n21 Beer: it's not just for breakfast\nanymore.\n22 The glass keeps missing your mouth.\n23 Bill Clinton starts to make sense.\n24 When you go to donate blood and they\nask what proof?\n25 Vampires get woozy after biting you.\n26 The only drinking problem is not\nhaving a drink right now.\n27 At AA meeting you begin: \"Hi, my name\nis... uh...\"\n28 Your idea of cutting back is less\nseltzer.\n29 When vomiting becomes a relief.\n30 Having a hard time staying on the side\nwalk - left, right, stumble, fall\n31 You wake up in the bedroom, your\nunderwear is in the bathroom.\n32 Barney, that dinosaur is damned funny!\n33 You think, Four Basic Food Groups are\nCaffeine, Nicotine, Alcohol, and Women.\n34 Every night you're beginning to find\nyour roomate's cat more attractive.\n35 Hi ocifer.

Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, \"Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table.

Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!!

The bartender serves him a beer and says, \"OK, truck drivers aren't nerds.\"\n\nAs he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in wearing a pair of glasses with tape around the middle, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt that is at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver asks him why he did that.\n\nThe bartender replied, \"Don't worry. The computer nerds are in season because they are overpopulating Silicon Valley. You don't even need a license.\"\n\nSo the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads for the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the road. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, snatching up all of the computers. The scavengers are comprised of engineers, accountants and programmers - computer geeks. Each of them wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.\n\nHe can't let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, killing several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.\n\nThe truck driver said, \"What's wrong? I thought computer nerds were in season.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" says the patrolman, \"But you can't bait 'em!\"", "categories": ["Crazy Jokes"], "score": "2.5976", "maturity": "1", "size": "339", "similarity": "0.034120948052881024", "cos_score": "0.034120948052881024", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Being told to \"Think Outside the Box\" when I'm in the @#$%? box all day!\n\nNot being able to check E-mail attachments without first seeing who is behind me.\n\nFabric cubicle walls do not offer much protection from any kind of gun fire.\n\nThat nagging feeling that if I just press the right button, I will get a piece of cheese.\n\nLack of roof rafters for the noose.\n\nMy walls are too close together for my hammock to work right.\n\nWomen: Damned near impossible to adjust your bra or slip without comment.\n\nMen: Co-workers tend to stare when you loosen your pants to tuck in your shirt.\n\n23 power cords, 1 outlet.\n\nPrison cells are not only bigger, they have beds.\n\nWhen tours come through, I get lots of peanuts thrown at me.\n\nCan't slam the door when you quit and walk out.", "categories": ["Business"], "score": "3.1163", "maturity": "1", "size": "144", "similarity": "0.03409791885577197", "cos_score": "0.03409791885577197", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Three women were talking about their sons.One woman said that her son is a priest and every time he walks into a room people bow their head and say \"Father\".The second woman said that HER son was a cardinal and every time he walked into a room people bowed their head and said \"your Grace\".The third woman was silent.

The only reason why we drink water or smoke at all is to ferret out all those users who don't have eMail or a telephone line.\n\nSend urgent eMail ALL IN UPPERCASE. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.\n\nWhen you call a tech's direct line, press 5 to skip the bilingual greeting that says he's out of town for a week, record your message, and wait exactly 24 hours before you send an eMail straight to the director because no one ever returned your call. You're entitled to common courtesy.\n\nWhen the photocopier doesn't work, call computer\nsupport.  There's electronics in it, right?\n\nWhen you're getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call computer support. We can even fix telephone problems from here.\n\nWhen something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on a tech's chair with no name, no phone number, and no description of the problem. We love a good mystery.\n\nWhen you have a tech on the phone walking you through changing a setting; read the paper. We don't actually mean for you to DO anyhing; we just love to hear ourselves talk.\n\nWhen we offer training on the upcoming OS upgrade, don't bother. We'll be there to hold your hand after it is done. \n\nWhen the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20 times. Print jobs frequently just disappear into the cosmos for no reason.\n\nWhen the printer still won't print after 20 tries, send the job to all 68 printers in the office. One of them is bound to work.\n\nDon't use online help. Online help is for wimps.\n\nIf you're taking night classes in computer science, feel free to go around and update the network drivers for you and all your coworkers.  We're grateful for the overtime when we have to stay until 2:30am fixing them.\n\nWhen you have a tech fixing your computer at a quarter past one, eat your lunch in his face. We function better when slightly dizzy.\n\nDon't ever thank us. We love this AND we get paid for it!\n\nWhen a tech asks you whether you've installed any new software on this computer, lie. It's nobody's business what you've got on your computer.\n\nIf the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse cables were designed to have 45 lbs. of computer sitting on top of them.\n\nIf the space bar on your keyboard doesn't work, blame it on the mail upgrade. Keyboards work much better with half a pound of muffin crumbs, nail clippings, and big sticky drops of Coke under the keys.\n\nWhen you get the message saying \"Are you sure?\", click on that Yes button as fast as you can.  Hell, if you weren't sure, you wouldn't be doing it, would you?\n\nFeel perfectly free to say things like \"I don't know nothing about that computer crap\".  It never bothers us to hear our area of professional expertise referred to as crap.\n\nWhen you need to change the toner cartridge, call tech support. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only by a professional engineer with a Master's degree in nuclear physics.\n\nWhen something's the matter with your computer, ask your secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of having to deal with a third party who doesn't know anything about the problem.\n\nWhen you receive a 30-meg movie file, send it to everyone as a high-priority mail attachment. We've got plenty of disk space and processor capacity on that mail server.\n\nDon't even think of breaking large print jobs down into smaller chunks.  God forbid somebody else might get a chance to squeeze into the queue.\n\nWhen you bump into a tech in the grocery store on a Saturday, ask a computer question. We work 24/7, even while at the grocery store on weekends.\n\nIf your son is a student in computer science, have him come in on the weekends and do his projects on your office computer. We'll be there for you when his illegal copy of Visual Basic 6.0 makes your Access database flip out.\n\nWhen you bring us your own no-brand home PC to repair for free at the office, tell us how urgently we need to fix it so your son can get back to playing DOOM.  We'll get right on it because we have so much free time at the office.

Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room.\nLunch:  Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house.\nDinner:  Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.\nBedtime snack:  Steal one green bean from your spouse's or partner's plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator.

In his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off, he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra.\n\nWhat actually happened should serve as a lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration. First, because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn, the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra, missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor, driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience.\n\nFortunately, the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury, for the chairs collapsed under them, passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them, who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on, like a row of dominos. The sound  of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically, adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the Overture.\n\nMeanwhile, all of this unplanned choreography notwithstanding, back on stage Paolo's Waterloo was still unfolding. According to Paolo, \"Just as I heard the sound of the blast, time seemed to stand still. Everything moved in slow motion. Just before I felt\nsearing pain to my mouth, I could swear I heard a voice with an Austrian accent say, 'Fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul unopposeet reakshon!'\" \n\nWell, this should come as no surprise, for Paolo had set himself up for a textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics. Having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone, he allowed the energy of the blast to send a superheated jet of gas backwards through the tubing of the trombone, through the mouthpiece, burning his lips and face.\n\nThe pyrotechnic ballet wasn't over yet. The force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny Yamaha right down the middle, turning it inside out, while at the same time propelling Paolo backwards off the riser. And for the grand finale, as Paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone, allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone's slide like a double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist, knocking him unconscious.\n\nThe moral of the story?

It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away.

You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nMy father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.\"\n\nBut life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.  Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae\".\n\nWhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.\n\nBut there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.\n\nWhen I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.  I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.  And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing: \"Al, we need you in Washington.\"\n\nI knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other business -- building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field's chocolate chip cookies.\n\nFinally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for no particular\nreason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.\n\nSince then, I've been part of the most successful administration in American history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do.  And when I would give him\nmy thoughts, he would invariable say, \"Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?\" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away from that dark-haired intern.\n\nSo after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.  And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, \"Al, just tell the truth, it's always worked for me.\"", "categories": ["Political"], "score": "3.2892", "maturity": "None", "size": "746", "similarity": "0.01859321509825529", "cos_score": "0.01859321509825529", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "1.

He said all he wanted was for Santa to fill them.\n\nWhat they say about Santa checking the list twice must be true because every Christmas morning, although Jay's kids' stockings were overflowed, his poor panty hose hung sadly empty and grew increasingly threadbare.\n\nOne year I decided to make his dream come true. I put on sunglasses and a fake beard and went in search of an inflatable love doll.\n\nOf course, they don't sell those things at Wal-Mart. I had to go to an adult bookstore downtown. If you've never been in an X-rated store, don't go. You'll only confuse yourself.\n\nI was there almost three hours saying things like, \"What does this do?\" \"You're kidding me!\" \"Who owns that?\" \"Do you have their phone number?\"\n\nFinally, I made it to the inflatable doll section.\n\nI wanted to buy a standard, uncomplicated doll suitable for a night of  romance that could also substitute as a passenger in my car so I could use the car pool lane during rush hour.\n\nI'm not sure what a complicated doll is. Perhaps one that is subject to wild mood shifts and using a French accent for no reason at all. (That also describes a few ex-boyfriends.)\n\nFinding what I wanted was difficult. Love dolls come in many different models.\n\nThe top of the line, according to the side of the box, could do things I'd only seen in a book on animal husbandry. I figured the \"vibro-motion\" was a feature Jay could live without, so I settled for Lovable Louise. She was at the bottom of the price scale. To call Louise a \"doll\" took a huge leap of imagination.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, with the help of an old bicycle pump, Louise came to life. My sister-in-law was in on the plan and cleverly left the front door key hidden under the mat. \n\nIn the wee morning hours, long after Santa had come and gone, I snuck into the house and filled the dangling panty hose with Louise's pliant legs and bottom. I also ate some cookies and drank what remained of a glass\nof milk on a nearby tray.\n\nThen I let myself out, went home, and giggled for a couple of hours.\n\nThe next morning my brother called to say that Santa had been to his house and left a present that had made him VERY happy but had left the dog confused. He would bark, start to walk away, then come back and bark some more. I suggested he purchase an inflatable Lassie to set Rover straight.\n\nWe also agreed that Louise should remain in her panty hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came over for the traditional Christmas dinner.\n\nIt seemed like a great idea, except that we forgot that Grandma and Grandpa would be there. My grandmother noticed Louise the moment she walked in the door.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" she asked. My brother quickly explained.  \"It's a doll.\"\n\n\"Who would play with something like that?\" Granny snapped. I had several candidates in mind, but kept my mouth shut. \"Where are her clothes?\" Granny continued. I hadn't seen any in the box, but I kept this information to myself.\n\n\"Boy, that turkey sure smells nice, Gran,\" Jay said, trying to steer her into the dining room.\n\nBut Granny was relentless. \"Why doesn't she have any teeth?\" Again, I could have answered, but why would I? It was Christmas and no one wanted to ride in the back of the ambulance saying, \"Hang on Granny, Hang on!\"\n\nThe dinner went well.\n\nWe made the usual small talk about who had died, who was dying, and who should be killed, when suddenly Louise made a noise that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the morning. Then she lurched from the panty hose, flew around the room twice, and fell in a heap in front of the sofa.\n\nThe cat screamed, I passed cranberry sauce through my nose, and Grandpa ran across the room, fell to his knees, and began administering mouth to mouth resuscitation.\n\nMy brother wet his pants and Granny threw down her napkin, stomped out of the room, and sat in the car.\n\nIt was indeed a Christmas to treasure and remember.", "categories": ["Holidays"], "score": "3.2892", "maturity": "1", "size": "741", "similarity": "0.0183114949162951", "cos_score": "0.0183114949162951", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "The jumbo jet is just coming into Pearson Airport in Toronto on its final approach.The pilot comes on over the intercom and says, \"Ladies and gentlemen.

I learned their customs and mannerisms by observing them, much the way Jane Goodall learned about the great apes, but without the hassle of grooming.\n\nEngineering is so trendy these days that everybody wants to be one. The word \"engineer\" is greatly overused.  If there's somebody in your life who you think is trying to pass as an engineer, give him this test to discern the truth.\n\nEngineer Indentification Test\n\nYou walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging crooked.\nYou...\n\n\nStraighten it.\nIgnore it.\nBuy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a solar-powered, self-adjusting picture frame while often stating aloud your belief that the inventor of the nail was a total moron.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C\" but partial credit can be given to anybody who writes \"It depends\" in the margin of the test or simply blames the whole stupid thing on \"Marketing.\"\n\nSocial Skills\nEngineers have different objectives when it comes to social interaction.\n\n\"Normal\" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from social interaction:\n\nStimulating and thought-provoking conversation\nImportant social contacts\nA feeling of connectedness with other humans\n\nIn contrast to \"normal\" people, engineers have rational objectives for social interactions:\n\nGet it over with as soon as possible.\nAvoid getting invited to something unpleasant.\nDemonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects.\n\n\nFascination with Gadgets\n\nTo the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of two categories: (1)things that need to be fixed, and (2)things that will need to be fixed after you've had a few minutes to play with them. Engineers like to solve problems.  If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.  Normal people don't understand this concept; they believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet.\n\nNo engineer looks at a television remote control without wondering what it would take to turn it into a stun gun.  No engineer can take a shower without wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering unnecessary. To the engineer, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and feature-poor toys.\n\nFashion and Appearance\n\nClothes are the lowest priority for a engineer, assuming the basic thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied.  If no appendages are freezing or sticking together, and if no genitalia or mammary glands are swinging around in plain view, then the objective of clothing has been met. Anything else is a waste.\n\nLove of Star Trek\n\nEngineers love all of the \"Star Trek\" television shows and movies.  It's a small wonder, since the engineers on the starship Enterprise are portrayed as heroes, occasionally even having sex with aliens.  This is much more glamorous than the real life of an engineer, which consists of hiding from the universe and having sex without the participation of other life forms.\n\n\nDating and Social Life\n\nDating is never easy for engineers.  A normal person will employ various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression of attractiveness. Engineers are incapable of placing appearance above function.\n\nFortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole.  They are widely recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable, employed, honest, and handy around the house.  While it's true that many normal people would prefer not to date an engineer, most normal people harbor an intense desire to mate with them, thus producing engineer-like children who will have high-paying jobs long before losing their\nvirginity.\n\nMale engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos in their mid thirties to late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistible\nmen in technical professions: \n\nBill Gates.\nMacGyver.\nEt cetera.\n\nFemale engineers become irresistible at the age of consent and remain that way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death.  Longer if it's a warm day.\n\nHonesty\n\nEngineers are always honest in matters of technology and human relationships. That's why it's a good idea to keep engineers away from customers, romantic interests, and other people who can't handle the truth. \n\nEngineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work.  They say things that sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could be expected to believe them. The complete list of engineer lies is listed below.\n\n\"I won't change anything without asking you first.\"\n\"I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow.\"\n\"I have to have new equipment to do my job.\"\n\"I'm not jealous of your new computer.\"\n\nFrugality\n\nEngineers are notoriously frugal.  This is not because of cheapness or mean spirit; it is simply because every spending situation is simply a problem in optimization, that is, \"How can I escape this situation while retaining the greatest amount of cash?\"\n\nPowers of Concentration\n\nIf there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything else in the environment.  This sometimes causes engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely.  Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have started checking resumes before processing the bodies.  Anybody with a degree in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he or she snaps out of it.\n\nRisk\n\nEngineers hate risk.  They try to eliminate it whenever they can.  This\nis understandable, given that when an engineer makes one little mistake,\nthe media will treat it like it's a big deal or something.\n\nExamples of Bad Press for Engineers\n\nHindenberg.\nSpace Shuttle Challenger.\nSPANet(tm)\nHubble space telescope.\nApollo 13.\nTitanic.\nFord Pinto.\nCorvair.\n\nThe risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this:\n\nRISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people.\nREWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.\n\nBeing practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks and\nrewards and decide that risk is not a good thing.  The best way to avoid\nrisk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for\nreasons that are far too complicated to explain.\n\nIf that approach is not sufficient to halt a project, then the engineer\nwill fall back to a second line of defense: \"It's technically possible\nbut it will cost too much.\"\n\n\nEgo\n\nEgo-wise, two things are important to engineers:\nHow smart they are.\nHow many cool devices they own.\n\nThe fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to declare that\nthe problem is unsolvable.  No engineer can walk away from an unsolvable\nproblem until it's solved.  No illness or distraction is sufficient to\nget the engineer off the case.  These types of challenges quickly become\npersonal -- a battle between the engineer and the laws of nature.\n\nEngineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem.\n(Other times just because they forgot.)  And when they succeed in\nsolving the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than\nsex--and I'm including the kind of sex where other people are involved.\n\nNothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion that\nsomebody has more technical skill.  Normal people sometimes use that\nknowledge as a lever to extract more work from the engineer.  When an\nengineer says that something can't be done (a code phrase that means\nit's not fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance at\nthe engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say something along\nthese lines:  \"I'll ask Bob to figure it out.  He knows how to solve\ndifficult technical problems.\"\n\nAt that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand\nbetween the engineer and the problem.  The engineer will set upon the\nproblem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.", "categories": [], "score": "2.7705", "maturity": "1", "size": "1368", "similarity": "0.01819745620980389", "cos_score": "0.01819745620980389", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "A chicken and an egg check into a cheap motel room.Moments later the chicken sits up against the headboard and lights a cigarette.

My wife seemed very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get started.\n\nDay 1\nThey suggest I keep this \"exercise diary\" to chart my progress this\nweek.\n\nStarted the morning at 6:00 AM. Tough to get up, but worth it when I arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me. She's something of a goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile. She showed  me the machines and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She seemed a little alarmed that it\nwas so high, but I think just standing next to her in that outfit of hers added ten points.\n\nEnjoyed watching the aerobics class. Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though my gut was already aching a little from holding it in the whole time I was talking to her. This is going to be GREAT!\n\nDay 2\nTook a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it. Tanya had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the air. Then she put weights on it, for heaven's sake! Legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made it the full mile. Her smile made it all worth it. Muscles\nfeel GREAT!!\n\nDay 3\nThe only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the tooth brush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I am certain that I have developed a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was okay as long as I didn't try to steer. I parked on top of a Volkswagen.\nTanya was a little impatient with me and said my screaming was bothering the other club members. The treadmill hurt my chest so I did the stair monster. Why would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by the invention of elevators? Tanya told me regular exercise would make me\nlive longer. I can't imagine anything worse.\n\nDay 4\nTanya was waiting for me with her vampire teeth in a full snarl. I can't help it if I was half an hour late, it took me that long just to tie my shoes. She wanted me to lift dumbbells. Not a chance, Tanya. The word \"dumb\" must be in there for a reason. I hid in the men's room until she sent Lars looking\nfor me. As punishment she made me try the rowing machine. It sank.\n\nDay 5\nI hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. If there was any part of my body not in extreme pain I would hit her with it. She thought it would be a good idea to work on my triceps. Well I have news for you Tanya, I don't have triceps. And if\nyou don't want dents in the floor don't hand me any barbells.\n\nI refuse to accept responsibility for the damage, YOU went to sadist school, YOU are to blame.

He showed them both a shiny metal \nbox with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever.  \"What \ndo you think this is?\"\n     \nOne advisor, an engineer, answered first. \"It is a toaster,\" he \nsaid. The king asked, \"How would you design an embedded computer \nfor it?\" The engineer replied, \"Using a four-bit microcontroller,\nI would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and \nquantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow \nwhite to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as \nthe index to a 16-element table of initial timer values.  Then it \nwould turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the \ninitial value selected from the table.  At the end of the time \ndelay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back \nnext week, and I'll show you a working prototype.\"\n     \nThe second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized \nthe danger of such short-sighted thinking.  He said, \"Toasters \ndon't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen \nwaffles.  What you see before you is really a breakfast food \ncooker.  As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, \nthey will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food\ncooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled \neggs.  A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete.  If \nwe don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign \nthe toaster in just a few years.\"\n     \n\"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem.  First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses:  grains, pork, and poultry.  The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, \nhard-boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet \nclasses.\"\n     \n\"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance.  At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.'  The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.\"\n     \n\"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has \nrevealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of \nbreakfast food.  In the design phase, we have discovered some \nderived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented \nlanguage with multiple inheritance.  Of course, users don't want \nthe eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent \nprocessing is required, too.\"\n     \n\"We must not forget the user interface.  The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing.  Users  won't buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface.  When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen.  Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v. 8.3' appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 \nshould be out by the time the product gets to the market.)  Users \ncan pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook.\"\n     \n\"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase.  An Intel Pentium with 16MB of memory, a 160MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be \nsufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language\nthat supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing \nthe program will be a snap.

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n \"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n \"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n The beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n \"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n The beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n ", "categories": [], "score": "3.0925", "maturity": "None", "size": "1363", "similarity": "0.016634907471005836", "cos_score": "0.016634907471005836", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "The big game hunter gets talked into taking both his wife AND her mother along on one of his expeditions.It does not go well.

Yes, that was me at the front of the line in our local Get-a-Life Software store, waiting, waiting, for the moment when the future went on sale. And now that the future is installed in my computer, there's no looking back.\n\nTo be truthful, I don't use computers. They use me. They use me as a portal between the glittering new world of information and the mundane world where ordinary people have to eat and talk and sometimes be sad. Computers use my nimble fingers to unlock their codes, releasing raw information into the ether. Taking my mission as seriously as I do, I wanted the most up-to-the-second tool on the market. And that's why, the day after I installed Windows 2001, I was back at Get-a-Life buying the upgrade, Windows 2001, version 2.0.\n\nWith Windows 2001 2.0, I don't process information. I download it into my body. Using Windows' revolutionary US-ME serial port installed in my navel, I plug myself into my computer. Like the umbilical cord that fed me when I was mere flesh, the US-ME cable feeds raw data straight into my bloodstream. There it flows until it reaches the central processing unit I used to call my brain. And there, Windows' revolutionary Brain Bot - a tiny microchip embedded in my cerebrum -- turns that raw data into wisdom that makes me smarter, richer, and so much wiser than the rest of you.\n\nDid you know that the capital of Uganda is Kampala? That Soupy Sales had a lion puppet named Pookie? That the square root of 3 is 1.732? And that today's kids will spend 23 years of their lives on the Internet swimming through vital data like this? O, it's a changing world, my friend. When you leave your Silicon Valley job for two weeks of R & R, take a cruise to Antarctica, step onto an ice floe and see penguins crowded around a laptop checking out The Weather Channel, get worried!\n\nBut I'm not worried, I'm wired. Wired to the upgraded upgrade I bought last weekend. Windows 2001 3.0 is the one with HandPrint, the printer driver that drives my digital age. Using HandPrint, I don't need an ordinary printer. I just click a button on my wrist and my hand begins scrolling across a blank page printing my raw data in any of 1,257 perfect fonts. The moving hand writes, and having writ, gives way to ear-mail.\n\nI know, I know. You all have e-mail accounts. You can e-mail Bill Gates if you want. The Pope. Your dog if you're on vacation in Antarctica. But only Windows 2001 4.0, which I bought yesterday, has ear-mail.\n\nWhen I hear a voice from the ether saying \"You've got mail!\" I run to the nearest phone.

The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a \"Thanks for flying XYZ airline.\" He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, \"Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?\" \"Why no Ma'am,\" said the pilot, \"what is it?\" The little old lady said, \"Did we land or were we shot down?\"\n\nAfter a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant\ncame on with, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate.

The only appliance allowed is a variable-speed vibrator, adjustable to Slow, Medium, and Who Needs A Man.  Another wise choice is a new washing machine with a turbo spin cycle.  Makes laundry day go by pretty fast when you can at least sit on it during spin-dry and end up smiling throughout the evening. In other words, if you must buy her something that plugs in, make sure it gives her the kind of pleasure you never have.\n\nAny bulk cleaning supplies (e.g., \"Honey, I got you that large box of Tide you've been wanting!\" ... \"This Windex should last you a while\" ... \"I got a good deal on the industrial-strength toilet bowl cleaner.\"  All I can say is, be prepared to run (or die a painful death).

It gives her the idea that you do not consider her the sexy woman that she is. Take out that wallet and buy her something sexy from Victoria Secret (just like you did for your girlfriend).\n\nNo-name perfume which costs you $1.99, such as Eu de Toilet, which actually smells like the bathroom, a ten-dollar whore or your dirty socks. If you are going to buy her perfume, spring for the brand names.\n\nAny type of cubic zirconia jewelry you see on the Home Shopping Network. It will be quite embarrassing when she is showing off that fabulous diamond to her friends and tries to cut glass with it.

Well, perhaps you might if you're a transvestite, but all in all, believe me, she'll smile and say it's beautiful while choking back tears and mumbling under her breath, \"Where the hell would I ever wear this outfit without being arrested for bad\ntaste?\" An additional hint: plaids do not go with stripes (even though you think your golfing outfit looks just fine).  It's a known fact to the rest of the world that that is a taboo.\n\nDo not give her a gift certificate to Jenny Craig or Weight  Watchers.

Each charge  nurse will be issued a .38 caliber revolver and 12 rounds  of ammunition.  An additional 12 rounds will be stored in pharmacy.\n\nIn addition to routine nursing duties, charge nurses will  rotate the\npatrolling of the hospital grounds.  A bicycle  and helmet will be\nprovided for patrolling the parking  areas.  In light of the\nsimilarity of monitoring equipment,  ICU will now take over the\nsecurity surveillance duties.   The ward clerk will be responsible for\nwatching cardiac  monitors and security monitors as well as regular\nduties.\n\nFood service will be discontinued.  Patients wishing to be  fed will\nneed to let their families know to bring something  or may make\narrangements with Subway or Pizza Hut to  deliver.  Coin operated\ntelephones will be available in  patient rooms for this purpose as\nwell as for other calls  the patient may wish to make.\n\nHousekeeping and Physical Therapy will be combined.  Mops  will be\nissued to those patients who are ambulatory, thus  providing range of\nmotion exercises as well as a clean  environment.  Families and\nambulatory patients may also  sign up to clean the rooms of non-\nambulatory patients for  special discounts on their final bill.  Time\ncards will be  provided.\n\nAs you can see on the \"from\" line above, hospital administration is\nassuming the grounds keeping duties.   If an administrator cannot be\nreached by calling his/her  office, it is suggested that you walk\noutside and listen  for the sound of a lawnmower, weed-whacker, etc.\n\nMaintenance is being eliminated.  The hospital has  subscribed to the\nTime-Life \"How to...\" series of maintenance books.  These can be\nchecked out from  administration, and a toolbox will be standard\nequipment on  all nursing units.  We will be receiving the series at a\nrate of one volume every other month.  We already have the  volume on\n\"Basic Wiring\", but if a non-electrical problem  occurs, please try to\nhandle it as best you can until the  appropriate volume arrives.\n\nCutbacks in phlebotomy staff will be accommodated by only  performing\nblood-related tests on patients who are already  bleeding.\n\nPhysicians will be informed that they may order no more than two X-\nrays per patient stay.  This is due to the turn-around time required\nby Photomat.  Two prints will be provided for the price of one, and\nphysicians are being advised to clip coupons from the Sunday paper if\nthey want extra sets.\n\nPhotomat will also honor competitors coupons for one-hour  processing\nin emergency situations so if you come across any extra coupons please\nclip out and send these to ER.\n\nIn view of the hot summer temperatures, the Utilities Dept. has been\nasked to install individual meters in each patient  room, office,\netc., so that electrical consumption can be  monitored and\nappropriately billed.  Fans will be available  for sale or lease in\nthe hospital gift shop.\n\nIn addition to the current recycling programs, a bin for  collection\nof unused fruit and bread will soon be provided  on each floor.\nFamilies, patients, and the few remaining  employees are asked to\ncontribute discarded produce.   Pharmacy will utilize this for\nantibiotic production.

This information was included in an interesting, amusing article titled \"How Not to Rob a Bank,\" by Tim Clark, which appeared in the 1987 edition of The Old Farmers Almanac. Clark reported that in spite of the widespread use of surveillance cameras, 76 percent of bank robbers use no disguise, 86 percent never study the bank before robbing it, and 95 percent make no long-range plans for concealing the loot. Thus, he offered this advice to would-be bank robbers, along with examples of what can happen if the rules aren't followed:\n\nPick the right bank. Clark advises that you don't follow the lead of the fellow in Anaheim, Cal., who tried to hold up a bank that was no longer in business and had no money. On the other hand, you don't want to be too familiar with the bank. A California robber ran into his mother while making his getaway. She turned him in.\n\nApproach the right teller. Granted, Clark says, this is harder to plan. One teller in Springfield, Mass., followed the holdup man out of the bank and down the street until she saw him go into a restaurant. She hailed a passing police car, and the police picked him up. Another teller was given a holdup note by a robber, and her father, who was next in line, wrestled the man to the ground and sat on him until authorities arrived.\n\nDon't sign your demand note. Demand notes have been written on the back of a subpoena issued in the name of a bank robber in Pittsburgh, on an envelope  bearing the name and address of another in Detroit, and in East Hartford, Conn., on the back of a withdrawal slip giving the robber's signature and account number.\n\nBeware of dangerous vegetables. A man in White Plains, N.Y., tried to hold up a bank with a zucchini. The police captured him at his house, where he showed them his \"weapon.\"\n\nAvoid being fussy. A robber in Panorama City, Cal., gave a teller a note saying, \"I have a gun.  Give me all your twenties in this envelope.\" The teller said, \"All  I've got is two twenties.\" The robber took them and left.\n\nDon't advertise. A holdup man thought that if he smeared mercury ointment on his face, it would make him invisible to the cameras. Actually, it accentuated his features, giving authorities a much clearer picture. Bank robbers in Minnesota and California tried to create a diversion by throwing stolen money out of the windows of their cars. They succeeded only in drawing attention to themselves.\n\nTake right turns only. Avoid the sad fate of the thieves in Florida who took a wrong turn and ended up on the Homestead Air Force Base. They drove up to a military police guardhouse and, thinking it was a tollbooth, offered the security men money.\n\nProvide your own transportation. It is not clever to borrow the teller's car, which she carefully described to police. This resulted in the most quickly solved bank robbery in the history of Pittsfield, Mass.\n\nDon't be too sensitive. In these days of exploding dye packs, stuffing the cash into your pants can lead to embarrassing stains, Clark points out, not to mention severe burns in sensitive places -- as bandits in San Diego and Boston painfully discovered.\n\nConsider another line of work. One nervous Newport, R.I., robber, while trying to stuff his ill-gotten gains into his shirt pocket, shot himself in the head and died instantly. Then there was the case of the hopeful criminal in Swansea, Mass., who, when the teller told him she had no money, fainted. He was still unconscious when the police arrived.\n\n\nIn view of such ineptitude, it is not surprising that in 1978 and 1979,\nfor example, federal and state officers made arrests in 69 percent of\nthe bank holdups reported.", "categories": ["Police Jokes"], "score": "3.4621", "maturity": "None", "size": "677", "similarity": "0.011404939513247624", "cos_score": "0.011404939513247624", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Romeo:   \"Somebody loves me.\" Juliet:   \"Who loves you?\" Romeo:   \"Do you know that beautiful girl who moved into the corner house last week?

U.S. ARMY\n\nAG 4110.99 (DEBCA)20 September 1944\n\nSUBJECT:  Indoctrination for Return to U.S.\n\nTO:  All Units.\n\nIn compliance with current policies for rotation of armed forces overseas it is directed that in order to maintain the high standard of character of the American Soldier and to prevent any dishonor to reflect on the uniform all individuals eligible for return to the U.S. under current directives will undergo an indoctrination course of demilitarisation prior to approval of his application for return.\n\nThe following points will be emphasized in the subject indoctrination course:\n\nIn America there is a remarkable number of beautiful girls. These young ladies have not been liberated and many are gainfully employed as stenographers, sales girls, beauty operators or welders.  Contrary to current practice they should not be approached with \"How much?\".  A proper greeting is \"Isn't it a lovely day?\" or \"Have you ever been to Chicago?\".  Then say \"How much?\".\n\nA guest in a private home is usually awakened in the morning by a light tapping on his door, and an invitation to join the host at breakfast. It is proper to say \"I'll be there shortly\". DO NOT say \"Blow it out your _____\".\n\nA typical American breakfast consists of such strange foods as cantalopes, fresh eggs, milk, ham, etc. These are highly palatable and though strange in appearance are extremely tasty.  Butter, made from cream, is often served. If you wish some butter, you turn to the person nearest it and say quietly \"Please pass the butter\". DO NOT say \"Threw me the god damn grease\".\n\nVery natural urges are apt to occur when in a crowd. If it is found necessary to defecate, one does NOT grab a shovel in one hand and paper in the other and run for the garden. At least 90% of American homes have one room called the \"Bathroom\", i.e.  a room that, in most cases, contains a bathtub, wash basin, medicine cabinet, and a toilet.  It is the latter that you will use in this case. (Instructors should make sure that all personnel understand the operation of toilet, particularly the lever or button arrangement that serves to prepare the device for reuse).\n\nIn the event the helmet is retained by the individual, he will refrain from using it as a chair, wash bowl, foot bath or bathtub.  All these devices are furnished in the average American Home.  It is not considered good practice to squat Indian fashion in a corner in the event all chairs are occupied.  The host usually will provide suitable seats.\n\nBelching or passing wind in company is strictly frowned upon. If you should forget about it, however, and belch in the presence of others, a proper remark is \"Excuse me\". DO NOT say \"It must be that lousy chow we've been getting\".\n\nAmerican dinners, in most cases, consist of several items, each served in a separate dish.  The common practice of mixing various items, such as corn-beef and pudding, or lima beans and peaches, to make it more palatable will be refrained from.  In time the \"Separate Dish\" system will become enjoyable.\n\nAmericans have a strange taste for stimulants.  The drinks in common usage on the Continent, such as underripe wine, alcohol and grapefruit juice, or gasoline bitters and water (commonly known by the French as \"Cognac\") are not usually acceptable in civilian circles.  A suitable use for such drinks is for serving one's landlord in order to break an undesirable lease.\n\nThe returning soldier is apt to find often that his opinions differ from those of his civilian associates.  One should call upon his reserve etiquette and correct his acquaintance with such remarks as \"I believe you have made a mistake\", or \"I am afraid you are in error on that\".  DO NOT say \"Brother, you're really f----d up\".  This is considered impolite.\n\nUpon leaving a friend's home after a visit, one may find his hat misplaced.  Frequently it has been placed in a closet.  One should turn to one's host and say \"I don't seem to have my hat.  Could you help me find it?\". DO NOT say \"Don't anybody leave this room, some S.O.B. has stolen my hat\".\n\nIn traveling in the U.S., particularly in a strange city, it is often necessary to spend the night.  Hotels are provided for this purpose and almost anyone can give directions to the hearest hotel.  Here, for a small sum, you can register and be shown to a room where you can sleep for the night. The present practice of entering the\nnearest house, throwing the occupants into the yard and\ntaking over the premises will cease.\n\nWhiskey, a common American drink, may be offered to the soldier on social occasions.  It is considered a bad reflection on the uniform to snatch the bottle from the  hostess and drain the bottle, cork and all.  All individuals are cautioned to exercise extreme control in these circumstances.\n\nIn motion picture theaters seats are provided.  Helmets are not required. In is NOT considered good form to whistle every time a female over 8 and under 80 crosses the screen. If vision is impaired by the person in the seat in front, there are plenty of other seats which can be occupied.  DO NOT hit him across the back of the head and say \"Move your head, jerk, I can't see a damn thing\".\n\nIt is not proper to go around hitting everyone of draft age in civilian clothes.  He might have been released from the service for medical reasons.  Ask for his credentials, and if he can't show any THEN go ahead and slug him.\n\nUpon retiring, one will often find a pair of pajamas laid out on the bed. (Pajamas, it should be explained, are two-piece garments which are donned after all clothing has been removed.) The soldier, confronted by these garments, should assume an air of familiarity and not act as though he were not used to them. A casual remark such as \"My, what a delicate shade of blue\" will usually suffice. Under NO circumstances say \"How in hell do you expect me to sleep in a get-up like that?\".\n\nNatural functions will continue. It may frequently be necessary to urinate.  DO NOT walk behind the nearest tree or automobile you find to accomplish this. Toilets (see 2d above) are provided in all public buildings for this purpose.\n\nBeer is sometimes served in bottles.  A cap remover is usually available, and it is not good form to open the bottle by the use of one's teeth.\n\nAlways tip your hat before striking a lady.\n\nAir raids and enemy patrols are not encountered in America. Therefore it is not necessary to wear the helmet in church or at social gatherings, or to hold the weapon at ready, loaded and cocked, when talking to civilians in the street.\n\nEvery American home and all hotels are equipped with bathing facilities. When it is desired to take a bath, it is not considered good form to find the nearest pool or stream, strip down, and indulge in a bath. This is particularly true in heavily populated areas.\n\nAll individuals returning to the U.S. will make every effort to conform to the customs and habits of the regions visited, and to make themselves as inconspicuous as possible. Any actions which reflect upon the honor of the uniform will be promptly dealt with.", "categories": ["Military"], "score": "2.9434", "maturity": "1", "size": "1254", "similarity": "0.010994767128504309", "cos_score": "0.010994767128504309", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "An American woman of 40 wants to get married, but she is only willing to marry a man if he has never been with a woman.After several unsuccessful years of searching, she decides to take out a personal ad.

Snarling and barking, I let them know in no uncertain terms that I was prepared to tear them from limb to limb it they came any closer, and was able to repel the invasion.

I don't want to seem ungrateful, but crunching through two inches of rock-hard beef is hardly my idea of a delicacy.\n\n2:00pm:  Most unpleasant experience when my master returned home and was furious that I had not eaten the plastic wrap which had been covering my present.  He kept pointing at the small pieces of Styrofoam and other debris and raving in a most irrational fashion.  I'm sorry, but he should know that I can't eat that stuff; it makes my stomach upset.

After several days in the sun, the aroma was so delicious it made my nose quiver.  I rolled in the wondrous fragrance for several minutes, and when I stood up I positively radiated eau de roadkill.  Let Sebastian drool over Muffy -- he doesn't know what he's missing.\n\n6:00pm:  Of all the times to get a bath!

One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl.

He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n Coincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n \"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n \"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n \"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n \"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n \"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n \"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n \"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n \"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n \"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n \"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n \"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n \"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n \"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n \"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n 3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n \"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n \"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n ... and what a dive...!\n Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n \"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n \"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n \"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n \"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n Then one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n \"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n \"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n up and up...\n below him the ship grew smaller...\n on and on...\n past a solitary albatross...\n and still higher...\n till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n and on still further...\n / till the ocean grew dim...\n and the earth itself...\n began to shrink...\n past our moon...\n and on...\n and Mars...\n and on...\n higher, and higher...\n through the asteroid belt...\n and on and on towards the diving board...\n past the outer planets, until...\n on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n he reached the board.\n He climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n and then...\n .'

You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler.   The coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is craving a full English breakfast. Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing, followed byaimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails.3 star hangover * * * - Slight headache.

You scare small children in the street just by walking past them.5 star hangover * * * * * - You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you. Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body.    Death seems pretty good right now. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic.   You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is breathe ... very gently.6 star hangover * * * * * * - You arrive home and climb into bed. Sleep comes instantly; as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi.  You get about 2 hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you up.  You notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying relentlessly around the room. No matter what you do you now, you're going to chuck. You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in ayacht under full sail. After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking off all the pictures, you find the toilet.

You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the walrus noises, spitting, and farting.  Help usually comes at this stage, even if it is short lived. Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into abuse and he/she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark. With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent. You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils projectile out your mouth on the last occasion. It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed.

They say cats lick\nthemselves clean. They say cats have a special enzyme of some sort in\ntheir saliva that works like New, Improved Wisk - dislodging the dirt\nwhere it hides and whisking it away.\n\nI've spent most of my life believing this folklore. Like most blind\nbelievers, I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary -\nthe kitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt\nsmudges that cling to the throw rug by the fireplace.\n\nThe time comes, however, when a man must face reality; when he must\nlook squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary\nand announce: \"This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in\nJuarez.\" When that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I\nhave some advice you might consider as you place your feline friend\nunder your arm and head for the bathtub:\n\nKnow that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack\nof concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength.\nCapitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try\nto bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick\na very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square,\nI recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the\nsliding-glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple\nshower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber\nshower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)\n\nKnow that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the\nskin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and\nknow how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls\ntucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves,\nan army helmet, a hockey face mask and a long-sleeve flak jacket.\n\nPrepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a\ntowel when you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the\nwater. Make sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass\nenclosure. Make sure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying\non your back in the tepid water.\n\nUse the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to\nsimply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice\nyour strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a\nrule. If he does notice your garb, calmly explain that you are taking\npart in a product testing experiment for J.C. Penney. Cats are\ngullible that way!)\n\nOnce you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In\na single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub\nenclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and\nsquirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds\nof your life. Cats have no handles when wet. Add the fact that he now\nhas soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect\nto hold on to him for more that two or three seconds at a time. When\nyou have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of\nshampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into\nthe water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record is -- for\ncats -- three latherings, so don't expect too much.)\n\nNext, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this\npart will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at\nthis point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the\ndrying is simple compared to what you have just been through. That's\nbecause by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg.\nYou simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and\nwait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top\nof your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to\nshake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the\nwater is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach\ndown and dry the cat.\n\nIn a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg.\nHe will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will\nspend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become\npsycho-ceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You\nwill be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case. As\na rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and\ninjure you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath.

They say cats lick themselves\nclean. They say cats have a special enzyme of some sort in their saliva\nthat works like new, improved Wisk - dislodging the dirt where it hides\nand whisking it away.\n\nI've spent most of my life believing this folklore. Like most blind\nbelievers, I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary - the\nkitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt smudges that\ncling to the throw rug by the fireplace.\n\nThe time comes, however, when a man must face reality; when he must\nlook squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary and\nannounce: \"This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in Juarez.\"\n\nWhen that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I have some\nadvice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you arm\nand head for the bathtub:\n\n* Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack\nof concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize\non that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him\nin an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small\nbathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that\nyou get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding-glass doors as if\nyou were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do.\nA berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than\na politician can shift positions.)\n\n* Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the\nskin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know\nhow to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into\nhigh-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet,\na hockey face mask and a long-sleeve flak jacket.\n\n* Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a towel\nwhen you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the water.\nMake sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure. Make\nsure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying on your back in the\nwater.\n\n* Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if\nto simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your\nstrange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule. If\nhe does notice your garb, calmly explain that you are taking part in a\nproduct- testing experiment for J.C. Penney.)\n\n* Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival.\nIn a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure,\nslide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with\nshampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. Cats\nhave no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem\nis radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more that\ntwo or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember\nto give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring\nfree and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national\nrecord is - for cats - three latherings, so don't expect too much.)\n\n* Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this\npart will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this\npoint and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying\nis simple compared to what you have just been through. That's because by\nnow the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop\nthe drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally,\nhowever, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If\nthis happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage\nhim toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is\na simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat.\n\nIn a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg.\nHe will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend\na lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic\nand develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.\n\nYou will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case.\nAs a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure\nyou for life the next time you decide to give him a bath.

Just like them, you lack imagination, but that's okay, not to worry, you're normal.\n\nSlow and Methodical\nYou follow the rules.  You're very tidy and orderly. You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do to the point of being anal retentive and irritating to others.  Stay out of the fast lane if you're only going to go the speed limit.\n\nFeverous Nibbles\nYour boss likes you because you get your work done quickly.

You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You have a propensity towards narcotic addiction.\n\nTwisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie.\nYou have a highly curious nature.  You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how they work, though not always able to put them back together, so you destroy all the evidence of your activities.  You deny your involvement when things go wrong. You are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if not criminal, behavior.\n\nTwisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie.\nYou are good at business and take risk that pay off.  You take what you want and throw the rest away.  You are greedy, selfish, mean, and lack feelings for others.  You should  be ashamed of yourself. But that's ok, you don't care, you got yours.\n\nJust the cookie, not the inside.\nYou enjoy pain.\n\nI just like to lick them, not eat them.\nStay away from small furry animals and seek professional medical help - immediately.\n\nI don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreos.\nYou probably come from a rich family, and like to wear nice things, and go to up-scale restaurants.

The catalogue that came in the mail offers a kit\nthat includes a cat toothbrush, cat toothpaste, cat breath spray and a\njar of something called \"gauze dental pads.\"\n\nI don't know what that last item is but my guess is that gauze dental\npads are what you put on your wounds after trying to brush the teeth of\na cat.\n\nOr maybe it is for the cat's wounds. You spend a few minutes trying to\nram a toothbrush into the face of a struggling cat and it isn't going to\ndo the cat any good either.\n\nIt may be that after each morning's brushing both you and the cat have\nto sit around dabbing at the surprising new openings all over your\nbodies.\n\nCats are not as enthusiastic about their dental hygiene as are the people\ntrying to sell you the products for that purpose. And some of those\nproducts are bizarre:\n\nThe cat toothpaste, for instance. It is flavored. Maybe that's not so odd\nby itself. A cat might be a little more willing to listen to reason on\nits dental hygiene if the toothpaste is mouse flavored or fish flavored or\nsomething like that. If they can sell people bourbon-flavored\ntoothpaste, they should be able to sell cats bird-flavored toothpaste.\nBirds are the bourbon of cats. You may stop by after work for a\nbourbon and water. But a cat prefers a couple of birds after a hard day\nof doing what cats do all day absolutely nothing.\n\nActually, I have never understood bourbon toothpaste, even for people\nwho love bourbon. Most people who love bourbon are not nearly so\nkeen on it first thing in the morning. People who use bourbon tooth\npaste are the same people who have a quick pull on the bottle when\nthey awaken just to get their blood moving. That's pretty hardcore.\n\nThe only people in deeper trouble are those who rinse with a stiff,\nhigh-alcohol mouthwash but don't spit. There are people who will tell\nyou they quit drinking years ago but who have started using mouth\nwash five times a day.\n\nThe cat toothpaste isn't bourbon-flavored but it is a long way from the\nflavor you would expect just the same: Malt. The toothpaste they are\nselling for cats is malt-flavored.\n\nI was unaware that cats like malt. But who am I to question? For all I\nknow, they may not stop by after a hard day of doing nothing for a\nbourbon and water, but maybe cats do like some sort of\nsparrow-and-malt blender drink a malted bird shake. (If anybody would\ngo for blender drinks it is those hairy sissies who call themselves\ncats.)\n\nI have no idea why cat toothpaste is malt flavored. My first guess was\nthat it had something to do with bad breath. But the catalogue specifies\nmalt \"flavored.\" And the tooth kit includes a separate container of\nbreath spray for the way a cat's breath smells.\n\nThe breath spray must be for the benefit of people who let cats breathe\nin their faces at close range. I don't even let people breathe in my face\nat close range.\n\nBut some cat owners are into that sort of thing and I'll concede I would\nuse a breath spray on the cat if I were in the habit of sharing air with\na creature that has just finished drinking a sparrow-and-malt blender\ndrink.\n\nOf course, cat products aren't the only silly part of a pampered pet\ncatalogue. They also have toothpaste for dogs. And they specify that it\nis \"no-rinse\" toothpaste. It is no-rinse toothpaste because dogs don't\nknow how to spit. And they don't want to learn. Dogs specialize in\nputting things into their mouths, not in expelling them.\n\nIn other words, they swallow their toothpaste. That gives you a rough\nidea of what dog toothpaste is made of: It's a blender drink made of\nmalt and cat.", "categories": ["Animals"], "score": "3.1163", "maturity": "None", "size": "710", "similarity": "0.007352575170695527", "cos_score": "0.007352575170695527", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "A lady who is cheating on her husband There's a lady who is cheating on her husband.

Six cups of flour, four\ncups of sugar, three sticks of butter.  Of course, it would have been cheaper\nto remove the feline ingredient, pick out the hairs, and just rename the\nrecipe Paw Print Cookies.\n\nOn the second day of Christmas, my kitten accompanied me...\nOn a trip to the vet clinic.  Who knew that skinny curling ribbon has feline\ntaste appeal?  I didn't.  Damages:  $28 for the office visit, $36 for\nanesthesia so the veterinarian could take $55 X-rays in case Sara had\ntaste-tested any other Christmas decorations, and a heck of a lot of\nembarrassment when the vet removed the 3\" curly tail in slightly less than\ntwo seconds by tugging at it with a pair of tweezers.\n\nOn the third day of Christmas, my kitten wrecked for me...\n13 ornaments on my Christmas tree.  My mistake was forgetting to chain the\ndecorations to the branches.  My other error was leaving the room to go to\nthe bathroom while Sara feigned sleeping under the tree.

Apparently, anything in the same bag as catnip takes on its\npotent aroma for a very long time.

The plane bounced across the water as it strained to get airborne, but the overloaded aircraft finally ran out of space and crashed into the trees. Some time later, the hunters regained consciousness. \"Where are we?\" one asked.

Today, while printing all the invoices, I ran out of printer paper, so I ran down to the local office supply store and picked up several boxes of Xerox MultiUse Paper.\n\nWhile the invoices were printing, I noticed something on the package of paper that concerned me, and I thought I'd better check with you about it. On the box, there is a little thing that says 99.99% jam free.  I know that sometimes wood finds its way into paper, but jam? I was always taught to keep all food and drinks away from\ncomputer equipment, especially something as sticky as jam.\n\nNow, I realize that it is a very small amount of jam in each piece of paper, but we use an awful LOT of paper, my friends, and all that jam is sure to add up.  Won't that adversely affect the life of our printer?  I mean, I'm sure you know what you're doing when it comes to paper, but we use more than the average consumer, so maybe we would be better off with a \"Jam-free\" paper, if you offer such a product.  I will look for it next time I am shopping, which will be soon, as I don't want to use any more of this paper until I find out if it's really safe.\n\nIf it is safe, why not say \"Contains .01% jam, but it's perfectly safe\" in big letters, since I'm sure that I am not the only one who has this concern.  You may end up selling a lot more paper that way.\n\nBy the way, I'm curious as to why you would even put jam in paper. Does it help bond everything together so it doesn't look like confettii? Just curious.  Also, I'd appreciate a Xerox keychain.\n\nThanks,\n\nDave Cilluffo\nPO Box 731\nEdinboro Pa 16412-0731\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your message.\nWe greatly appreciate your taking the time to send us your feedback regarding our 99.99% jam free paper.  We have restricted the manufacture of paper to the morning because we have so many folks who eat jam for lunch.  Nevertheless, it has been our experience that small amounts of jam have found its way into the paper via morning bagels and jam-filled\ndonuts.\n\nOur tests have shown that the .01% jam isn't harmful to machinery and you may continue to use it.  In fact the jam has improved the overall quality of the finished print.  However, you may have to keep a can of ant spray around.  You may wish to enhance paper\nperformance by using the 99.99% jam free paper with our new line of 99.99% peanut butter free paper.  They absolutely work best when used together.  Or if you prefer you can save time by using the 99.99% PB & J free paper.

In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.\n One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher\u2019s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.\n Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! \u201cThank you, young men\u201d said the fairy, \u201cYour hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?\u201d\n \u201cThis is my friend Set, and you can call me \u2018Ep\u2019\u201d, said Amenhotep.\n \u201cVery well, Ep\u201d said the fairy \u201cWhat is the desire of your heart?\u201d\n \u201cI wish I was the strongest man in the world!\u201d Amenhotep wished. \n \u201cVery well\u201d, said the fairy, \u201cbut you must always use your strength to help others.\u201d Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. \n The fairy turned to Set \u201cAnd what is your wish, Set?\u201d\n Set responded \u201cI never want to be poor again! I wish for money!\u201d\n \u201cVery well,\u201d said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. \u201cGreetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!\u201d\n \u201cElmon is an expert in all things money,\u201d said the fairy, \u201cHe will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.\u201d\n Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname \u201cImp\u201d. With Elmon\u2019s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  \n Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. \n Ep and Set\u2019s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. \n As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.\n Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.\n Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature\u2019s effect on Set\u2019s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.\n Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.\n Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.\n Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set\u2019s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. \u201cCome, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let\u2019s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.\u201d\n Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon\u2019s murder.\n The case was brought before the court, but Set\u2019s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.\n Obviously, Ep\u2019s teen didn\u2019t kill Imp\u2019s elf.", "categories": [], "score": "3.2840", "maturity": "1", "size": "802", "similarity": "0.005937888745689592", "cos_score": "0.005937888745689592", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "A tourist walks into a pet shop in Silicon Valley, and is browsingthe cages on display.

Find a marble (the big steelies work even better) and roll that down the floor as the sprints continue. See how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before it disappears under the fridge. Finally, work on that upper body strength. Climbing is a great exercise. Use draperies, macram\u00e9 plant hangers, or clothing on hangers. You can even find some carpeting on some basement walls. Backs of chairs work well, too.\n\nNow put it all together.

Sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. Worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.\n\nFollowing are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.\n\nIf you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  Untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.\n\nIf you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  Most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.\n\nIf you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  One note of caution, competent technical people have been known to\ninadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like PC Week or LAN Times.  If the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as \"stuff\" and \"things\", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.\n\nIf during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term \"trick\".  For example \"maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated\". This is a sure sign of technical harassment.\n\nIf a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. If you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you\nhave only been technically annoyed.\n\nIf when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  It is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have\npurchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.

WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK THESE DEVICES\nRIGHT AT THE FACTORY BEFORE WE SHIP THEM OUT, YOU KNOW THAT?!?\n\nWe're sorry.  We just get a little crazy sometimes because we're always getting back \"defective\" merchandise where it turns out that the consumer\ninadvertently bathed the device in acid for six days.  So, in writing these instructions, we naturally tend to assume that your skull is filled with dead insects, but we mean nothing by it.  OK?  Now let's talk about:\n\n\nUNPACKING THE DEVICE\n\nThe device is encased in foam to protect it from the Shipping People, who like nothing more than to jab spears into outgoing boxes.\n\nPLEASE INSPECT THE CONTENTS CAREFULLY FOR GASHES OR IDA MAE BARKER'S\nENGAGEMENT RING, WHICH SHE LOST LAST WEEK, AND SHE THINKS MAYBE IT WAS\nWHILE SHE WAS PACKING DEVICES.\n\nIda Mae really wants that ring back, because it is her only proof of engagement, and her fiancee, Stuart, is now seriously considering backing out on the whole thing in as much as he had consumed most of a bottle of Jim Beam in Quality Control when he decided to pop the question.  It is not without irony that Ida Mae's last name is \"Barker\", if you get our drift.\n\nWARNING: DO NOT EVER AS LONG AS YOU LIVE THROW AWAY THE BOX OR ANY OF THE PIECES OF STYROFOAM, EVEN THE LITTLE ONES SHAPED LIKE PEANUTS.\n\nIf you attempt to return  device to the store, and you are missing one\nsingle peanut, the store personnel will laugh at you in the chilling\nmanner exhibited by Joseph Stalin just after he enslaved Eastern Europe.\n\nBesides the device, the box should contain:\n\nEight little rectangular snippets of paper that say \"WARNING\"\nA little plastic packet containing four 5/17 inch pilfer grommets and two club-ended 6/93 inch boxcar prawns.\n\nYOU WILL NEED TO SUPPLY: a matrix wrench and 60,000 feet of tram cable.\n\nIF ANYTHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING:  You IMMEDIATELY should turn to your spouse and say \"Margaret, you know why this country can't make a car that\ncan get all the way through the drive-through at Burger King without a major transmission overhaul?  Because nobody cares, that's why.\"\n\nWARNING:\nThis is assuming your spouse's name is Margaret, and not Harvey.\n\nPLUGGING IN THE DEVICE\n\nThe plug on this device represents the latest thinking of the electrical industry's Plug Mutation Group, which, in a continuing effort to prevent consumers from causing hazardous electrical current to flow through their appliances, developed the Three-Pronged Plug, then the Plug Where One Prong\nis Bigger Than the Other.  Your device is equipped with the revolutionary\nnew Plug Whose Prongs Consist of Six Small Religious Figurines Made of Chocolate. Connecting this device should only be attempted by a qualified electrician.  Lay the power cord gently on the floor near an outlet, but out of direct sunlight, and clean it weekly with a damp handkerchief.\n\nWARNING: WHEN YOU ARE LAYING THE PLUG ON THE FLOOR, DO NOT\nHOLD A SHARP OBJECT IN YOUR OTHER HAND AND TRIP OVER THE CORD\nAND POKE YOUR EYE OUT, AS THIS COULD VOID THE WARRANTY.\n\nOPERATION OF THE DEVICE\n\nWARNING: WE MANUFACTURE ONLY THE ATTRACTIVE DESIGNER CASE. THE ACTUAL\nWORKING CENTRAL PARTS OF THE DEVICE ARE MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN. THE\nINSTRUCTIONS WERE TRANSLATED BY MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER OF ACCOUNTS\nRECEIVABLE, WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO JAPAN BUT DOES HAVE MOST OF\n\"SHOGUN\" ON TAPE.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:  For results that can be the finest, it is our advising that: NEVER to hold  these buttons two times!!  Except the battery. Next taking the (something) earth section may cause a large occurrence!  However.  If this is not a trouble, such rotation is a very maintenance action, as a kindly (something) viewpoint from Figure B.\n\nFigure B\n\n\nWARRANTY\n\nBe it hereby known that this device, together with but not excluding all those certain parts thereunto, shall be warrantied against all defects, failures and malfunctions as shall occur between now and Thursday afternoon shortly before 2, during which time the Manufacturer will, at no charge to\nthe Owner, send the device to our Service People, who will emerge from their caves and engage in rituals designed to cleanse it of evil spirits.

Then, just when your computer is getting excited about the invasion, it breaks off the connection with your computer, dashing its hard drive against the rocks.\n\nThe \"I'm looking for more of a commitment\" virus - Receives the \"I love you\" virus email and immediately schedules a recurring event called \"hold for my sweetie\" for Friday and Saturdays into your calendar and the calendar of the person who sent the mail, registers you for a year of pre-paid videos at Blockbuster.com, and deletes any appointments called \"Golf with the guys\" or \"Night out with the Girls.\"  It also erases the phone number from the contact card for your 'ex', and puts in a monthly reminder for the anniversary of your first date.\n\nThe \"One Night Stand\" virus invades your computer, turns its hard drive upside down, then disappears after promising to come back sometime.

Since it snowed last night, I got up early and made a sled with old barn wood and a glue gun. I hand painted it in gold leaf, got out my loom, and made a blanket in peaches and mauves. Then to make the sled complete, I made a white horse to pull it, from DNA that I had just sitting around in my craft room.\n\nBy then, it was time to start making the place mats and napkins for my 20 breakfast guests. I'm serving the old standard Stewart twelve-course breakfast, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I didn't have time to make the tables and chairs this morning, so I used the ones I had on hand.\n\nBefore I moved the table into the dining room, I decided to add just a touch of the holidays. So I repainted the room in pinks and stenciled gold stars on the ceiling. Then, while the homemade bread was rising, I took antique candle molds and made the dishes (exactly the same shade of pink) to use for breakfast. These were made from Hungarian\nclay, which you can get at almost any Hungarian craft store.\n\nWell, I must run. I need to finish the buttonholes on the dress I'm wearing for breakfast. I'll get out the sled and drive this note to the post office as soon as the glue dries on the envelope I'll be making.\n\nHope my breakfast guests don't stay too long, I have 40,000 cranberries to string with bay leaves before my speaking engagement at noon. It's a good thing.\n\nLove,\nMartha Stewart\n\nP.S. When I made the ribbon for this typewriter, I used 1/8-inch gold gauze.

The new element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. However, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.\n\nSince it has no electrons, Administratium is totally inert. However, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. According to its discovers, a tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.\n\nAdministratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.\n\nResearch at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. It is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.\n\nScientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.", "categories": ["Business"], "score": "3.1163", "maturity": "None", "size": "271", "similarity": "0.004005437465975991", "cos_score": "0.004005437465975991", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.

Users\nare the difference between good and bad applications, a function I have\nreserved unto myself! Who authorized you to have users?\"\n\n\"Well, IBM...\"\n\n\"IBM!! You!!

Usually a systems programmer who has been forced\ninto system administration; writes scripts in a polyglot of the Bourne\nshell, sed, C, awk, perl, and APL.\n\n\nThe Administrative Fascist. Usually a retentive drone (or rarely,\na harridan ex-secretary) who has been forced into system administration.\n\n\nThe Maniac. Usually an aging cracker who discovered that neither\nthe Mossad nor Cuba are willing to pay a living wage for computer espionage.\nFell into system administration; occasionally approaches major competitors\nwith indesp schemes.\n\n\nThe Idiot. Usually a cretin, morpohodite, or old COBOL programmer\nselected to be the system administrator by a committee of cretins, morphodites,\nand old COBOL programmers.\n\n\n\nHow To Identify Your System Administrator:\n\n\nSITUATION: Low disk space.\nTechnical Thug: Writes a suite of scripts to monitor disk usage,\nmaintain a database of historic disk usage, predict future disk usage via\nleast squares regression analysis, identify users who are more than a standard\ndeviation over the mean, and send mail to the offending parties. Places\nscript in cron. Disk usage does not change, since disk-hogs, by nature,\neither ignore script-generated mail, or file it away in triplicate. Administrative\nFascist: Puts disk usage policy in motd. Uses disk quotas. Allows no\nexceptions, thus crippling development work. Locks accounts that go over\nquota. Maniac:\n# cd /home\n# rm -rf `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`;\n\nIdiot:\n# cd /home\n# cat `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{ printf \"%s/*\n\", $2}'`\n| compress\n\nSITUATION: Excessive CPU usage.\nTechnical Thug: Writes a suite of scripts to monitor processes,\nmaintain a database of CPU usage, identify processes more than a standard\ndeviation over the norm, and renice offending processes. Places script\nin cron. Ends up renicing the production database into oblivion, bringing\noperations to a grinding halt, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.\nAdministrative Fascist: Puts CPU usage policy in motd. Uses CPU\nquotas. Locks accounts that go over quota. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling\ndevelopment work, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.

(By hand, NOT with passmgmt.) Slaps on setuid\nbit; tells a nearby secretary to handle new accounts. Usually, said secretary\nis still dithering over the difference between 'enter' and 'return'; and\nso, no new accounts are ever created.\nAdministrative Fascist: Puts\nnew account policy in motd. Since people without accounts cannot read the\nmotd, nobody ever fulfills the bureaucratic requirements; and so, no new\naccounts are ever created.\nManiac: \"If you're too stupid to break\nin and create your own account, I don't want you on the system. We've got\ntoo many goddamn sh*t-for-brains a**holes on this box anyway.\"\nIdiot:\n# cd /home; mkdir \"Bob's home directory\"\n# echo \"Bob Simon:gandalf:0:0::/dev/tty:compress -f\" > /etc/passwd\n\n\nSITUATION: Root disk fails.\nTechnical Thug: Repairs drive.

This is a wonderful time of year when the humans decorate the home for us cats in anticipation of the visit from Santa Claws. The tree went up yesterday, and so did I.  Made it to the fourth branch within the first five minutes before the Big Owner chased me out of the tree.\n\nSo, as I do every year, I waited and watched the humans decorate the \nCat-mas tree with all sorts of what the humans call \"ornaments.\"  I call them \"cat toys.\"\n\nOrnaments are invitations to a cat, bright and shiny spheres just daring a cat to knock them off.  Every year the humans hang the ornaments a little higher out of my range, forcing me to elevate my game to knock them off. Humans \"ohhh and ahhh\" as they decorate the Cat-mas tree.  I salivate in anticipation of the night's activities.\n\nThe humans retire to bed, as is custom during Cat-mas season, leaving me to play with my tree.  Tonight is a challenge, the ornaments are at an all time high.  I crept under the tree and began to scale branches.  This is great!  A tree in my own home, why don't they do this year-round?  Five, six, seven branches, I climb like a pro.  Ten, twelve, I am half way to the top, and there is the first ornament!  This is easy as Cat-mas fruitcake.\n\nI make my way down the branch approaching the first ornament.  It lightly jiggles as my weight causes the bough to bend.  Almost there!  One paw away and I feel a shudder.  Something is not right, I begin to lose my balance.  The room is tilting!  No, the room is not tilting, the Cat-mas tree is falling!  It seemed like forever as the tree leaned, then pitched, and finally crashed to the floor in a resounding bang of exploding bulbs, ornaments, and broken limbs.  I quickly extricated myself from the splintered tree just as the Big\nOwner game bursting in snapping on the lights.  There I was, sitting\nnext to the tree, as innocent a look on my face as any other in the household.\n\n\"What happened?\" he growled.  Not a peep from me, I turned and looked at the tree.  \"I guess we hung too many ornaments on one side of the tree,\" I heard him say later as he hoisted the mangled Cat-mas tree back into place.\n\n\"Good answer,\" I thought.  The Big Owner staggered off to bed, and I\nretreated to the living room.  Maybe I'll tear down those stockings that were hung by the chimney with care.\n\nIt was good day.\n\n\nFrom the Cat Diary\nTo Subscribe, email to [email\u00a0protected]\nCopyright 1999 Mark Mason All Rights Reserved", "categories": ["Holidays"], "score": "3.4621", "maturity": "None", "size": "463", "similarity": "0.0035795722724457487", "cos_score": "0.0035795722724457487", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "In an effort to clarify questions about the purported durability and unusual\nphysical characteristics of Twinkies, I subjected the Hostess snack logs\nto the following experiments:\n\nExposure\nA Twinkie was left on a window ledge for 4 days, during which time an inch\nand a half of rain fell. Many flies were observed crawling across the Twinkie's\nsurface, but contrary to hypothesis, birds -- even pigeons -- avoided this\npotential source of substance.\n\nDespite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun, the Twinkie retained\nits original color and form. When removed, the Twinkie was found to be\nsubstantially dehydrated. Cracked open, it was observed to have taken on\nthe consistency of industrial foam insulation; the filling however, retained\nits advertised \"creaminess\"\n\nRadiation\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven, which was set for\nprecisely 4 minutes -- the approximate cooking time of bacon. After 20\nseconds, the oven began to emit the Twinkie's rich, characteristic aroma\nof artificial butter. After one minute, this aroma began to resemble the\nacrid smell of burning rubber. The experiment was aborted after 2 minutes\n10 seconds when thick, foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven.\nA second Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment; this Twinkie leaked\nmolten white filling. When cooled, this now epoxylike filling bonded the\nTwinkie to its plate, defying gravity: it was removed only upon application\nof a butter knife.\n\nExtreme Force\nA Twinkie was dropped from a ninth-floor window, a fall of approximately\n120 feet. It landed right side up, then bounced onto its back. The expected\n\"splatter\" effect was not observed. Indeed, the only discernible damage\nto the Twinkie was a narrow fissure on its underside; otherwise, the Twinkie\nremained structurally intact.\n\nExtreme Cold\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours. Upon removal,\nthe Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid, but its physical properties\nhad noticeably \"slowed\". The filling was found to be the approximate consistency\nof acrylic paint, while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering\nto practically any surface. It was noticed the Twinkie had generously absorbed\nthe freezer odors.\n\nExtreme Heat\nA Twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes. While the Twinkie smoked\nand blackened and the filling in one of its \"cream holes\" boiled, the Twinkie\ndid not catch fire. It did, however produce the same \"burning rubber\" aroma\nnoticed in the irradiation experiment.\n\nImmersion\nA Twinkie was dropped into a large bucket filled with water, the Twinkie\nfloated momentarily, then began to list and sink. Viscous yellow tendrils\nran off its lower half, possibly consisting of a water-soluble artificial\ncoloring. After 2 hours, the Twinkie bloated substantially. Its coloring\nwas now a very pale tan -- in contrast to the yellow, urine-like water\nthat surrounded it. The Twinkie bobbed when touched, and had a gelatinous\ntexture. After 72 hours the Twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of\nits original size. The water had turned opaque, and a small, fan-shaped\nspray of filling had leaked from one of the \"cream holes\".

I have\npasted together the following \"history\" of the world from certifiably genuine\nstudent bloopers collected by teachers throughout the United States, from\neighth grade through college level. Read carefully, and you will learn\na lot.\n\n\n\nThe inhabitants of Egypt were called mummies. They lived in the Sarah\nDessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that\nthe inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the dessert\nare cultivated by irritation. The Egyptians built the Pyramids in the\nshape of a huge triangular cube. The Pramids are a range of mountains between\nFrance and Spain.\n\nThe Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the\nBible, Guinesses, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of\ntheir children, Cain, asked \"Am I my brother's son?\" God asked Abraham\nto sacrifice Issac on Mount Montezuma. Jacob, son of Issac, stole his brother's\nbirthmark. Jacob was a partiarch who brought up his twelve sons to be partiarchs,\nbut they did not take to it. One of Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse to\nthe Israelites.\n\nPharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw. Moses\nled them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread\nmade without any ingredients. Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide\nto get the ten commandments. David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing\nthe liar. He fougth with the Philatelists, a race of people who lived in\nBiblical times. Solomon, one of David's sons, had 500 wives and 500 porcupines.\n\nWithout the Greeks, we wouldn't have history. The Greeks invented three\nkinds of columns - Corinthian, Doric and Ironic. They also had myths. A\nmyth is a female moth. One myth says that the mother of Achilles dipped\nhim in the River Stynx until he became intolerable. Achilles appears in\n\"The Illiad\", by Homer. Homer also wrote the \"Oddity\", in which Penelope\nwas the last hardship that Ulysses endured on his journey. Actually, Homer\nwas not written by Homer but by another man of that name.\n\nSocrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice.\nThey killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.\n\nIn the Olympic Games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits,\nand threw the java. The reward to the victor was a coral wreath. The government\nof Athen was democratic because the people took the law into their own\nhands. There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so high that\nthey couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were doing. When they\nfought the Parisians, the Greeks were outnumbered because the Persians\nhad more men.\n\nEventually, the Ramons conquered the Geeks. History call people Romans\nbecause they never stayed in one place for very long. At Roman banquets,\nthe guests wore garlic in their hair. Julius Caesar extinguished himself\non the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March killed him because they\nthought he was going to be made king. Nero was a cruel tyrany who would\ntorture his poor subjects by playing the fiddle to them.\n\nThen came the Middle Ages. King Alfred conquered the Dames, King Arthur\nlived in the Age of Shivery, King Harlod mustarded his troops before the\nBattle of Hastings, Joan of Arc was cannonized by George Bernard Shaw,\nand the victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. Finally,\nthe Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the\nsame offense.\n\nIn midevil times most of the people were alliterate. The greatest writer\nof the time was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verse and also wrote\nliterature. Another tale tells of William Tell, who shot an arrow through\nan apple while standing on his son's head.\n\nThe Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value\nof their human being. Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at Wittenberg\nfor selling papal indulgences. He died a horrible death, being excommunicated\nby a bull. It was the painter Donatello's interest in the female nude that\nmade him the father of the Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions\nand discoveries. Gutenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a\nhistorical figure because he invented cigarettes. Another important invention\nwas the circulation of blood. Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with\na 100-foot clipper.\n\nThe government of England was a limited mockery. Henry VIII found walking\ndifficult because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth was the\n\"Virgin Queen.\" As a queen she was a success. When Elizabeth exposed\nherself before her troops, they all shouted \"hurrah.\" Then her navy went\nout and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.\n\nThe greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespear. Shakespear\nnever made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He lived\nin Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies and errors.\nIn one of Shakespear's famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by\nrelieving himself in a long soliloquy. In another, Lady Macbeth tries to\nconvince Mac- beth to kill the King by attacking his manhood. Romeo and\nJuliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Writing at the same time as\nShakespear was Miquel Cervantes. He wrote \"Donkey Hote\". The next great\nauthor was John Milton. Milton wrote \"Paradise Lost.\" Then his wife dies\nand he wrote \"Paradise Regained.\"\n\nDuring the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great\nnavigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His\nships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe. Later the Pilgrims\ncrossed the Ocean, and the was called the Pilgrim's Progress. When they\nlanded at Plymouth Rock, they were greeted by Indians, who came down the\nhill rolling their was hoops before them. The Indian squabs carried porposies\non their back. Many of the Indian heroes were killed, along with their\ncabooses, which proved very fatal to them. The winter of 1620 was a hard\none for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain\nJohn Smith was responsible for all this.\n\nOne of the causes of the Revolutionary Wars was the English put tacks\nin their tea. Also, the colonists would send their pacels through the post\nwith- out stamps. During the War, Red Coats and Paul Revere was throwing\nballs over stone walls. The dogs were barking and the peacocks crowing.\nFinally, the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.\n\nDelegates from the original thirteen states formed the Contented Congress.\nThomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the\nDeclaration of Independence. Franklin had gone to Boston carrying all his\nclothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm. He invented electricity by rubbing cats backwards and declared \"a horse divided against\nitself cannot stand.\" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.\n\nGeorge Washington married Matha Curtis and in due time became the Father\nof Our Country. Them the Constitution of the United States was adopted\nto secure domestic hostility. Under the Constitution the people enjoyed\nthe right to keep bare arms.\n\nAbraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother\ndied in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his\nown hands. When Lincoln was President, he wore only a tall silk hat. He\nsaid, \"In onion there is strength.\" Abraham Lincoln write the Gettysburg\naddress while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an\nenvelope. He also signed the Emasculation Proclamation, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment gave the ex-Negroes citizenship. But the Clue Clux Clan would\ntorcher and lynch the ex-Negroes and other innocent victims. On the night\nof April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat\nby one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was\nJohn Wilkes Booth, a sup- posedl insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.\n\nMeanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare\ninvented electricity and also wrote a book called \"Candy\". Gravity was\ninvented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the Autumn, when\nthe apples are flaling off the trees.\n\nBach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel. Handel\nwas half German, half Italian and half English. He was very large. Bach\ndied from 1750 to the present. Beethoven wrote music even though he was\ndeaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest\neven when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later\ndied for this.\n\nFrance was in a very serious state. The French Revolution was accomplished\nbefore it happened. The Marseillaise was the theme song of the French Revolu-\ntion, and it catapulted into Napoleon. During the Napoleonic Wars, the\ncrowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes. Then the Spanish\ngorrilas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon's flanks. Napoleon\nbecame ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained. He\nwanted an heir to inheret his power, but since Josephine was a baroness,\nshe couldn't bear him any children.\n\nThe sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is\nin the East and the sun sets in the West. Queen Victoria was the longest\nqueen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years. He reclining years and finally\nthe end of her life were exemplatory of a great personality. Her death\nwas the final event which ended her reign.\n\nThe nineteenth century was a time of many great inventions and thoughts.\nThe invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up.\nCyrus McCormick invented the McCormick Raper, which did the work of a hundred\nmen. Samuel Morse invented a code for telepathy. Louis Pastuer discovered\na cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturailst who wrote the \"Organ\nof the Species\". Madman Curie discovered radium.

Then one terrible day when he was dangling over the furious lion, he lost his grip and fell. The mime was terrified. The lion gathered itself and prepared to pounce. The mime was so scared that he began to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. When no help came, and the crowd looked on in shock, the mime started screaming and yelling.Help, Help me!\" he screamed, but the lion was too quick and pounced. The mime found himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion, who was just inches away from his face when he whispered, \"Shut up you idiot!

The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a east coast resident, which was posted on the Internet.\n\nDear Dr. Laura:\n\nThank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law.\n\nI have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.\n\nI do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:\n\nWhen I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?\n\nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n\nI know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual unseemliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n\nLev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n\nI have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n\nA friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n\nLev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\nMost of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?\n\nI know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n\nMy uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n\nI know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.

Scoutmaster Webb is making us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search & rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.Scoutmster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if its hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver.In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic.

The naughty characters are punished for their sins. Naughty characters are those involved in the creation of naughty words, such as \"breast,\" \"sex\" and \"contraception.\"\n\nThe Buddhist explanation: If a character has lived rightly, and its karma is good, then after it has been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character. Those funny characters above the numbers on your keyboard will become numbers, numbers will become letters, and lower-case letters will become upper-case.\n\nThe 20th-century bitter cynical nihilist explanation: Who cares? It doesn't really matter if they're on the page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same.\n\nThe Mac user's explanation: All the characters written on a PC and then deleted go to straight to PC hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters, because you're in PC hell also.\n\nStephen King's explanation: Every time you hit the (Del) key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor, who tears the poor unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all. Hah, hah, hah!\n\nDave Barry's explanation: The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so flammable, while cheap imitations are not flammable. I'm not making this up.\n\nIBM's explanation: The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them. Get a life. \n\nPETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) explanation: You've been DELETING them??? Can't you hear them SCREAMING???

The man agrees that Chet certainly is pretty, but he doesn't seem to be much for singing.\n\nThe manager tells him to watch as he reaches into his pocket and pulls\nout a lighter.

My arthritis is acting up, my eyelashesare sore, my dog just died . . . \" 3. If they say they're John Doe from XYZ Company, ask them to spell their name. Then ask them to spell the company name. Then ask them where it is located, how long it has been in business, how many people work there, how they got into this line of workif they are married, how many kids they have, etc. Continue asking them personal questions or questions about their company for as long as necessary.4. This works great if you are male. Telemarketer: \"Hi, my name is Judy and I'm with XYZ Company. \" You: Wait for a second and with a real husky voice ask, \"What are you wearing?\"5.

Judy, how have you been?\" Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where she couldknow you from. 6. Say \"No\" over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each one, and keep a rhythmic tempo, even as they are trying to speak. This is most fun if you can do it until they hang up.7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up for the Family and Friends Plan, reply, in as sinister a voice as you can, \"I don't have any friends, would you be my friend?\"8. If the company cleans rugs, respond: \"Can you get out blood? Can you get out goat blood? How about human blood?\"9. After the Telemarketer gives his or her spiel, ask him or her to marry you.

There are side-effects though - some feline sufferers attack the rubbing hand while others recover spontaneously, often after prolonged treatment.  This condition is probably incurable and any cat which requires prolonged treatment after an attack will most likely suffer repeated attacks of collapsible legs throughout its lifetime. \n\nSnudging\nSymptoms:  The affected cat repeatedly headbutts any available part of a readily available human and turns its head slightly so that the lips and cheek are rubbed against legs, arms, clothing etc.  This condition gets its name from a contraction of the phrase \"soggy nudging\".  Snudging may well be a form of excessive scent-marking.  A bad attack can result in soggy clothing. \nTreatment:  Give the sufferer lavish affection.  Most attacks subside between 10 minutes to 1 hour after onset of symptoms.  You may need to dry off snudged clothing or skin.  Attacks recur frequently, usually when the most readily available human is engrossed in a TV program, book or telephone call. \n\nBed-Hogging\nSymptoms:   The cat spreads to take up all available free bed space at night.  It then expands a bit more until any human occupants occupy the smallest possible area of bed.  It may do this on top or underneath the covers or on the pillow.  It is highly contagious - any other cats on the bed will also develop symptoms of bed-hogging. \nTreatment:   The most obvious solution is to evict the cat from the bed.  If this is morally unfeasible, train yourself not to give way as the cat expands.  Buying a bigger bed is probably pointless as most affected cats can easily expand to fill standard, queen-sized and king-sized beds.  Otherwise, simply train yourself to sleep while hanging precariously off the side of the bed. Attacks of bed-hogging have been known to last up to 23 hours (in one case a 3-day attack was noted by a cat-owner who was confined to bed with flu; the cat thoughtfully kept her company during this time). \n\nNon-Specific Insect Infestation\n(also Non-Speficic Spider Infestation) \nSymptoms:  A disorder more prevalent among outdoor-going cats and cats with access to conservatories and garden rooms.  Symptoms range from minor (the odd greenfly in tail, money-spider on fur) to severe (entire ecosystems of insects living on cat, spider webs spun between ears/whiskers, cat so weighed down with spider webs that it has difficulty walking). \nTreatment:  Minor symptoms can be treated by simply removing the infesting agent (aphid, ladybug, spider etc) and combing webs out of fur.  If the cat suffers recurrent or severe symptoms an exercise regime is highly recommended since highly mobile cats appear to attract fewer greenfly (research into this factor continues). \n\nFuffling\nSymptoms:  The cat lowers its nose into water and exhales.  This is followed by whiffling, spluttering, sneezing, snorting, head-shaking and a generally confused expression.  Bath-foam appears to trigger attacks of fuffling in some cats.  It may also be linked to interesting items seen in the water e.g. goldfish, food-crumbs, greeblingz.  Fuffling is most common during kittenhood although even quite elderly may suffer an occasional bout. \nTreatment:  None.  Snorkelling apparatus or scuba suits are possibilities, but cats do not readily accept such treatment.  Kittenhood fuffling generally subsides as the cat grows older, possibly due to some acquired immunity (or greater common sense). \n\nIrritable Lap Syndrome\nSymptoms:  The cat appears unable to settle comfortably on laps, instead treading, kneading, rearranging itself, fidgeting, vocalising, getting up and turning around, falling off lap and getting back on again, attacking magazines, needlework, computer keyboard, telephone etc. \nTreatment:  Immediate treatment is essential.  Drop whatever you are doing (literally if need be) and give 100% attention to the sufferer otherwise symptoms may escalate and become quite distressing to the lap-owner.  Only prolonged attention will cure an attack of Irritable Lap Syndrome.  Like Collapsible Legs this syndrome is incurable, although attacks may be effectively treated as and when they occur. \n\nLap Fungus Disorder\nSymptoms:  Having taken over a human lap, the cat proceeds to spread in all planes. This may be accompanied by secondary symptoms such as high volume purring, dribbling, kneading and snoring.  The condition is highly contagious and several fungoid cats may infest a lap simultaneously. \nTreatment:  Topical treatment with proprietary anti-fungals is ineffective.  Prompt treatment (as per Irritable Lap Syndrome) is required to alleviate the worst symptoms although in a number of cats, such treatment actually aggravates the condition.  This disorder manifests itself periodically through the affected cat's life and there is no long-term cure. \n\nSmurgling\nSymptoms:  Varied:- sucking at clothing, owners earlobes/nose/fingers/skin, drooling, glazed expression.  Often accompanied by kneading and high volume purring. \nTreatment:  Ultimately incurable.  It is possible to remove smurglable items from around the cat.  The ailment may be transmitted to humans in the form of large laundry bills, mis-shapen clothing and chapped skin. \n\nGreeblingz\nSymptoms:  Random dashes through to helter-skelter running through house in pursuit of unseen prey.  Greeblingz are believed to be non-visible entities and some authorities have linked them to UFO sightings or feel that they may be diminutive other-dimensional beings.  Cats suffering from greeblingz typically have wild-eyed expressions.  There is a minor danger of greeblingz attaching themselves to humans; if a cat tackles such greeblingz, injury to humans may result.  A very few cats are naturally immune. \nTreatment:  None known.  Anti-epileptics are ineffective as the condition appears unrelated to other forms of seizure.  Avoid getting in the way of a cat engaged in greebling hunting.  Attacks usually subside spontaneously, perhaps as greeblingz return to their own dimension.  These irritating creatures are not visible to human eyes, but no doubt the superior sight and hearing of cats enables them to see them.", "categories": ["Animals"], "score": "3.2892", "maturity": "None", "size": "1048", "similarity": "0.0032111442594852796", "cos_score": "0.0032111442594852796", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Claim you were a Christmas tree in your former life.

(Associated Press)\n\nAfter four years of legal wrangling, George W.  Bush was finally declared the winner of the 2000 presidential election yesterday.\n\nBush, a Republican, will take the oath of office at noon today and serves until Jan. 20, 2005, a term of about three weeks.  Then he gives way to the winner of the 2004 presidential election, New York\nSen. Hillary Rodham Greenspan (formerly Clinton).\n\nFacing a drastically shortened presidency, Bush attempted to strike an optimistic tone last night.  \"We have a lot to accomplish in the next three weeks,\" Bush said.  \"Reforming Social Security alone is probably going to eat up four or five hours.  Let's get to work!\"\n \nAides yesterday were calling temporary employment agencies in a frantic effort to fill Cabinet posts.  Bush's victory ends a four-year court battle between him and Democratic candidate Al Gore over the\nresults of the 2000 election.\n\nWhile the dispute raged on, the nation installed an interim president - New York Yankees Manager Joe Torre.  Torre admitted that running a country and a baseball team simultaneously has been a strain.  \"At\ntimes, it's been difficult to keep the two things straight.  Although, in retrospect,trading Jesse Helms to the Red Sox turned out OK.\"\n\nTorre's four years in office were marked by continued prosperity at home and relative calm abroad.  His most controversial move was appointing Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer to the Supreme Court. Critics charged that Zimmer lacked experience.  He also spit tobacco juice on Antonin Scalia's shoes, angering conservatives.  Torre's boldest foreign policy initiative was making Cuba the 51st state in an\neffort to improve U.S. pitching.\n\nTorre was planning to vacate the White House by midnight tonight, with Bush moving in immediately.\n\nEager to give an aura of permanency to his three-week administration, Bush rebuffed suggestions that he sleep on a bare mattress on the floor and live out of suitcases.\n\nGore, meanwhile, has yet to concede defeat.  The former vice president issued a statement today saying, \"It would be improper and disrespectful to the democratic process to act hastily before all the facts are known.\" The legal tangle over the 2000 election began with a Gore lawsuit over the confusing design of ballots in Florida.  When the courts sided with Gore, Bush filed suit, arguing that the Oregon results were invalid because some ballots were yellow and others pink. Gore countersued, charging that the West Virginia results should be thrown out because some people failed to receive \"I Voted Today\"\nstickers.\n\nThrough the years, various officials proposed compromises to resolve the impasse.  All were rejected, including:\n\nEstablishing a co-presidency, with the two men sharing duties and splitting the White House.  Although never implemented, the idea gave rise to a hit TV show, East Wing, West Wing.\n\nEstablishing temporarily separate nations, with each candidate ruling the states he won in the 2000 election.  Gore, who failed to carry his native Tennessee, balked at the idea because it would mean\nshowing a passport every time he went home.\n\nObservers said the biggest challenge for the Bush administration will be working with Congress, which adjourns tomorrow and isn't expected back until after Bush's term ends.  \"One day may not be quite enough\ntime to overhaul the tax system,\" a Bush aide admitted.  \"But maybe we can get started and then finish it later with a big conference call or something.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bush also must work on his legacy and prepare to transfer power to President-elect Greenspan.

I now serve\nonly certain areas of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan. As\npart of the new and better contract I also get longer breaks for milk and\ncookies so keep that in mind.\n\nHowever, I'm certain that your children will be in good hands with your\nlocal replacement who happens to be my third cousin, Bubba Claus. His\nside of the family is from the South Pole. He shares my goal of delivering\ntoys to all the good boys and girls; however, there are a few differences\nbetween us.\n\nDifferences such as:\n\nThere is no danger of a Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus.\nHe has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads: \"These\ntoys insured by Smith and Wesson.\"\n\nInstead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an\nRC cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the fireplace. And Bubba doesn't\nsmoke a pipe. He dips a little snuff though, so please have an empty spit\ncan handy.\n\nBubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared, flying' coon dogs\ninstead of reindeer. I made the mistake of loaning him a couple of my\nreindeer one time, and Blitzen's head now overlooks Bubba's fireplace.\n\nYou won't hear \"On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen ...\" when\nBubba Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, \"On Earnhardt, on Wallace, on\nMartin and Labonte. On Rudd, on Jarrett, on Elliott and Petty.\"\n\n\"Ho, ho, ho!\" has been replaced by \"Yee Haw!\" And you also are likely\nto hear Bubba's elves respond, \"I her'd dat!\"\n\nAs required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have\na Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words \"Back off\"\nThe last I heard it also had other decorations on the sleigh back as well.\nOne is Ford or Chevy logo with lights that race through the letters and the\nother is a caricature of me (Santa Claus) going wee wee on the Tooth Fairy.\n\nThe usual Christmas movie classics such as \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and\n\"It's a Wonderful Life\" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing area.\nInstead, you'll see \"Boss Hogg Saves Christmas\" and \"Smokey and the Bandit\nIV\" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol cars\ncrashing into each other.\n\nBubba Claus doesn't wear a belt.

Ask among your coworkers. \"Hi,\" you should say. \"I'm a new employee. What is the name of my job?\" If they answer \"long-range planner\" or \"lieutenant governor,\" you are pretty much free to lounge around and do crossword puzzles until retirement. Most jobs, however, will require some work.\n\n\nThere are two major kinds of work in modern organizations:\n\n\n1. Taking phone messages for people who are in meetings, and, 2. Going to meetings.\n\n\nYour ultimate career strategy will be to get a job involving primarily No. 2, going to meetings, as soon as possible, because that's where the real prestige is. It is all very well and good to be able to take phone messages, but you are never going to get a position of power, a position where you can cost thousands of people their jobs with a single bonehead decision, unless you learn how to attend meetings.\n\n\nThe first meeting ever was held back in the Mezzanine Era. In those days, Man's job was to slay his prey and bring it home for Woman, who had to figure out how to cook it. The problem was, Man was slow and basically naked, whereas the prey had warm fur and could run like an antelope. (In fact it was an antelope, only nobody knew this).\n\n\nAt last someone said, \"Maybe if we just sat down and did some brainstorming, we could come up with a better way to hunt our prey!\" It went extremely well, plus it was much warmer sitting in a circle, so they agreed to meet again the next day, and the next.\n\n\nBut the women pointed out that, prey-wise, the men had not produced anything, and the human race was pretty much starving. \n\n\nThe men agreed that was serious and said they would put it right near the top of their \"agenda\". At this point, the women, who were primitive but not stupid, started eating plants, and thus modern agriculture was born. It never would have happened without meetings.\n\n\nThe modern business meeting, however, might better be compared with a funeral, in the sense that you have a gathering of people who are wearing uncomfortable clothing and would rather be somewhere else. The major difference is that most funerals have a definite purpose. Also, nothing is really ever buried in a meeting.\n\n\nAn idea may look dead, but it will always reappear at another meeting later on. If you have ever seen the movie, \"Night of the Living Dead,\" you have a rough idea of how modern meetings operate, with projects and proposals that everyone thought were killed rising up constantly from their graves to stagger back into meetings and eat the brains of the living.\n\n\nThere are two major kinds of meetings:\n\n\nMeetings that are held for basically the same reason that Arbor Day is observed - namely, tradition. For example, a lot of managerial people like to meet on Monday, because it's Monday. You'll get used to it. You'd better, because this kind account for 83% of all meetings (based on a study in which I wrote down numbers until one of them looked about right). This type of meeting operates the way \"Show and Tell\" does in nursery school, with everyone getting to say something, the difference being that in nursery school, the kids actually have something to say.\n\n\nWhen it's your turn, you should say that you're still working on whatever it is you're supposed to be working on. This may seem pretty dumb, since obviously you'd be working on whatever you're supposed to be working on, and even if you weren't, you'd claim you were, but that's the traditional thing for everyone to say. It would be a lot faster if the person running the meeting would just say, \"Everyone who is still working on what he or she is supposed to be working on, raise your hand.\" You'd be out of there in five minutes, even allowing for jokes. But this is not how we do it in America. My guess is, it's how they do it in Japan.\n\n\nMeetings where there is some alleged purpose. These are trickier, because what you do depends on what the purpose is. Sometimes the purpose is harmless, like someone wants to show slides of pie charts and give everyone a big, fat report. All you have to do in this kind of meeting is sit there and have elaborate fantasies, then take the report back to your office and throw it away, unless, of course, you're a vice president, in which case you write the name of a subordinate in the upper right hand corner, followed be a question mark, like this: \"Norm?\" \n\n\nThen you send it to Norm and forget all about it (although it will plague Norm for the rest of his career).\n\n\nBut sometimes you go to meetings where the purpose is to get your \"input\" on something. This is very serious because what it means is, they want to make sure that in case whatever it is turns out to be stupid or fatal, you'll get some of the blame, so you have to escape from the meeting before they get around to asking you anything. One way is to set fire to your tie.\n\n\nAnother is to have an accomplice interrupt the meeting and announce that you have a phone call from someone very important, such as the president of the company or the Pope. It should be one or the other. It would a sound fishy if the accomplice said, \"You have a call from the president of the company, or the Pope.\"\n\n\nYou should know how to take notes at a meeting. Use a yellow legal pad. At the top, write the date and underline it twice. \n\n\nNow wait until an important person, such as your boss, starts talking; when he does, look at him with an expression of enraptured interest, as though he is revealing the secrets of life itself. Then write interlocking rectangles like this: \n\n\n(picture of doodled rectangles).\n\n\nIf it is an especially lengthy meeting, you can try something like this (Picture of more elaborate doodles and a caricature of the boss).\n\n\nIf somebody falls asleep in a meeting, have everyone else leave the room.

Do small children with a fondness for peanut butter use your keyboard frequently? If so, you may want to clean it off for more reliable operation. First, disconnect your keyboard by gripping each of its ends firmly and pulling as hard as you can. Next, immerse the keyboard in warm water and scrub thoroughly with your favorite lemon-scented detergent and lots of steel wool. Finally, you need to dry the keyboard. Either dry it to touch with a handheld blowdryer, or place it in the dryer for not less than 60 minutes. Be sure to clean the lint screen when you are finished.\n\nQ. Why are there are no \"shift\" keys on my keyboard, but there are two keys labelled \"hif\"?\n\nA. Again, you may want to consider cleaning your keyboard, and washing your hands more frequently for that matter.\n\nQ. Are there shift keys on my Macintosh?\n\nA. Yes, although instead of the notation \"shift\", the key may be labelled with an excited Mac face, something like :O . Press this key to use shift, and be thankful you're using a friendly Mac instead of a mean old PC with all them confusin' words 'n stuff on it.\n\nQ. I'm sick of pushing the shift key every single time I want big letters. Is there any other way to do this?\n\nA. This is the Modern Age of Convenience, and you may be able to activate the shift key merely with the power of your voice! Check to see whether your computer is equipped with speech-recognition equipment by saying the word \"shift\" very clearly and slowly into its speaker. Then watch the keyboard closely to see if the Shift key moves down. Note that you may have to repeat this action several times to \"train\" the computer to recognise your voice before the feature works reliably.\n\nQ. There are two shift keys, which should I use?\n\nA. Avoid unnecessary wear on either shift key by alternating between the two. Keep track of your usage of each key so that you press them in equal amounts. Your keyboard may be equipped with a small notepad; you should use this to make little tally marks in two columns for each time you shift. Remember, it's better to go to a little trouble than wind up with a broken shift key.\n\nQ. Why are the shift keys bigger than the other keys?\n\nA. They aren't. This is simply an optical illusion. Just as the moon appears much larger when it is close to the horizon, your shift keys look larger because of their proximity to other keys. To verify this, go out in a large field at night with your keyboard, place it in an upright position, and view it from a distance of 200 yards. Sure enough, the keys all look the same size!\n\nQ. If I press the shift key at the wrong time, or too many times, will my computer explode?\n\nA. No. Well, generally no. Not unless you are using a NEC laptop. Or vt100 terminal emulation. But even then, hardly ever. Really, don't worry about it. Forget I mentioned it. Just type softly. Move along, next question.\n\nQ. No matter what I do, the shift key just doesn't seem to work. What's wrong?\n\nA. Have you ever considered that the problem may not be your keyboard, the problem may be YOU? Perhaps God Himself has suspended the operation of these keys to send you a Message that you have strayed from the path of righteousness. Use this as an opportunity to reflect on your life.

To get door opened, stand on\nhind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary\nto use it. After you have ordered an \"outside\" door opened, stand halfway\nin and out and think about several things. This is particularly important\nduring very cold weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors\nare to be avoided at all costs.\n\n** CHAIRS and RUGS:\n\nIf you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage\nin time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good.\nWhen throwing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as\nlong as the human's bare foot.\n\n** BATHROOMS:\n\nAlways accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything\n-- just sit and stare.\n\n** HAMPERING:\n\nIf one of your humans is engaged in some close activity and the other\nis idle, stay with the busy one. This is called \"helping\", otherwise known\nas \"hampering.\" Following are the rules for \"hampering\":\n\na) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook.\nYou cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on\nand then picked up and comforted.\n\nb) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book,\nunless you can lie across the book itself.\n\nc) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate\nmanner so as to obscure as much of the work or at least the most important\npart. Pretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil\nor knitting needles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember,\nthe aim is to hamper work.\n\nEmbroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of\nwhat the humans may tell you.\n\nd) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes\nor Christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim -- to hamper!\nFirst, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from\nthe side of the table. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the\npapers, scattering them to the best of your ability. After being removed\nfor the second time, push pens, pencils, and erasers off the table, one\nat a time.\n\ne) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure\nto jump on the back of the paper. They love to jump.\n\n** WALKING:\n\nAs often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front\nof the human, especially: on stairs, when they have something in their\narms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the morning. This will\nhelp their coordination skills.\n\n** BEDTIME:\n\nAlways sleep on the human at night so s/he cannot move round.\n\n** PLAY:\n\nThis is an important part of your life. Get enough sleep in the daytime\nso you are fresh for your nocturnal games. Below are listed several favorite\ncat games that you can play. It is important though to maintain one's Dignity\nat all times. If you should have an accident during play, such as falling\noff a chair, immediately wash a part of your body as if to say \"I MEANT\nto do that!\" It fools those humans every time.\n\nCAT GAMES:\n\n\"Catch Mouse\":\n\nThe humans would have you believe that those lumps under the covers\nare their feet and hands. They are lying. They are actually Bed Mice, rumored\nto be the most delicious of all the mice in the world, though no cat has\never been able to catch one. Rumor also has it that only the most ferocious\nattack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get\nthem. Maybe YOU can be the first to taste the Bed Mouse!\n\n\"King of the Hill\":\n\nThis game must be played with at least one other cat. The more, the\nmerrier! One or both of the sleeping humans is Hill 303 which must be defended\nat all costs from the other cat(s). Anything goes. This game allows for\nthe development of unusual tactics as one must take the unstable playing\ntheater into account.\n\nWARNING:\n\nPlaying either of these games to excess will result in expulsion from\nthe bed and possibly from the bedroom. Should the humans grow restless,\nimmediately begin purring and cuddle up to them.\n\nThis should buy you some time until they fall asleep again. If one happens\nto be on a human when this occurs, this cat wins the round of King of the\nHill.\n\n** TOYS:\n\nAny small item is a potential toy. If a human tries to confiscate it,\nthis means that it is a Good Toy. Run with it under the bed. Look suitably\noutraged when the human grabs you and takes it away.\n\nAlways watch where it is put so you can steal it later. Two reliable\nsources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets. There are several types\nof cat toys.\n\nBright shiny things like keys, brooches, or coins should be hidden so\nthat the other cat(s) or humans can't play with them. They are generally\ngood for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors.\n\nDangly and/or string-like things such as shoelaces, cords, gold chains,\nand dental floss also make excellent toys. They are favorites of humans\nwho like to drag them across the floor for us to pounce on. When a string\nis dragged under a newspaper or throw rug, it magically becomes the Paper/Rug\nMouse and should be killed at all costs. Take care, though. Humans are\nsneaky and will try to make you lose your Dignity.\n\n** PAPER BAGS:\n\nWithin paper bags dwell the Bag Mice. They are small and camouflaged\nto be the same color as the bag, so they are hard to see. But you can easily\nhear the crinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag. Anything,\nup to and including shredding the bag, can be done to kill them. Note:\nany other cat you may find in a bag hunting for Bag Mice is fair game for\na Sneak Attack, which will usually result in a great Tag match.\n\n** FOOD:\n\nIn order to get the energy to sleep, play, and hamper, a cat must eat.\nEating, however, is only half the fun. The other half is getting the food.\nCats have two ways to obtain food: convincing a human you are starving\nto death and must be fed *NOW*; and hunting for it oneself.\n\nThe following are guidelines for getting fed.\n\na) When the humans are eating, make sure you leave the tip of your tail\nin their dishes when they are not looking.\n\nb) Never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the\ntable.\n\nc) Never drink from your own water bowl if a human's glass is full enough\nto drink from.\n\nd) Should you catch something of your own outside, it is only polite\nto attempt to get to know it. Be insistent -- your food will usually not\nbe so polite and try to leave.\n\ne) Table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately\nunwilling to readily part. It is beneath the Dignity of a cat to beg outright\nfor food as lower forms of life such as dogs will, but several techniques\nexist for ensuring that the humans don't forget you exist. These include,\nbut are not limited to: jumping onto the lap of the \"softest\" human and\npurring loudly; lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the\nkitchen, the Direct Stare, and twining around people's legs as they sit\nand eat while meowing plaintively.\n\n** SLEEPING:\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to have enough energy for playing, a cat\nmust get plenty of sleep. It is generally not difficult to find comfortable\nplace to curl up. Any place a human likes to sit is good, especially if\nit contrasts with your fur color. If it's in a sunbeam or near a heating\nduct or radiator, so much the better. Of course, good places also exist\noutdoors, but have the disadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on\ncurrent and previous weather conditions such as rain. Open windows are\na good compromise.\n\n** SCRATCHING POSTS:\n\nIt is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide.\nThey are very protective of what they think is their property and will\nobject strongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it. Being sneaky\nand doing it when they aren't around won't help, as they are very observant.\nIf you are an outdoor kitty, trees are good. Sharpening your claws on a\nhuman is a definite no-no!\n\n** HUMANS:\n\nHumans have three primary functions: to feed us, to play with and give\nattention to us, and to clean the litter box. It is important to maintain\none's Dignity when around humans so that they will not forget who is the\nmaster of the house. Humans need to know basic rules. They can be taught\nif you start early and are consistent.\n\nYou will then have a smooth-running household.", "categories": ["Animals"], "score": "3.2892", "maturity": "1", "size": "1535", "similarity": "0.0017234776310142191", "cos_score": "0.0017234776310142191", "jac_score": "0.0", "sc_score": "0.0"}, {"text": "Martha Stewart Vs.

Could we lighten up?\n\n\n\nFROM: Pat Smith, Human Resources Director\nDATE: December 10  RE: Holiday Party\n\nVegetarians!?!?!? I've had it with you people!!! We're going to keep this party at Luigi's Open Pit Barbecue whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table  furthest from the \"grill of death,\" as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your #$%^&*! salad bar, including hydroponic tomatoes...but you know, they have feelings, too.  Tomatoes scream when you slice them. I've heard them scream, I'm hearing them scream right now!\n\n\n\nFROM: Karen Jones, Acting Human Resources Director\nDATE:  December 14  RE: Pat Smith and Holiday Party\n\nI'm sure I speak for all of us in wishing Pat Smith a speedy recovery from her stress-related illness and I'll continue to forward your cards to her at the sanitarium.  In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay.
