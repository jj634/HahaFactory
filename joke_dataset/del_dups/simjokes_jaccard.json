            "President George W. Bush is visiting an elementary school today and he visits one of the 4th grade classes. They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings.\n\nThe teacher asks the President if he would like to lead the class in the discussion of the word, \"tragedy.\" So the President asks the class for an example of a \"tragedy.\"\n\nOne little boy stands up and offers, \"If my best friend, who lives next door, is playing in the street and a car comes along and runs him over, that would be a tragedy.\"\n\n\"No\" says Bush, \"that would be an accident.\"\n\nA little girl raises her hand: \"If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone involved, that would be a tragedy.\"\n\n\"I''m afraid not\" explains the President. \"That''s what we would call a GREAT LOSS.\"\n\nThe room goes silent. No other children volunteer. President Bush searches the room. \"Isn''t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?\"\n\nFinally, way in the back of the room, a boy named Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, \"If Air Force One, carrying you and Mrs. Bush, was struck by a missile and blown up to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.\n\n\"Correct\" exclaims Bush, \"that''s right. And can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Lil'' Johnny said, \"because, like you just told us, it wouldn''t be an accident, and it sure as heck wouldn''t be a great loss.\""

The detective then turned to the 2nd blonde, stuck the photo in her face for 2 seconds, pulled it back and said, \"What about you? Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?\"\"Yes! He only has one ear!\"The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, \"Didn''t you hear what I just told the other lady? This is a profile of the man''s face! Of course you can only see one ear!! You''re excused, too!\"The 2nd blonde sheepishly walked out of the office. The detective turned his attention to the 3rd and last blonde and said, \"This is probably a waste of time, but.......\" He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying \"All right. Did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man?\"The blonde said, \"I did. This man wears contact lenses.\"The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, \"You''re absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts... How in the world could you tell that by looking at this picture?\"The blonde rolled her eyes and said, \"Well duh! With only one eye and one ear, he certainly can''t wear glasses!\"",
            "Three blondes were all vying for the last available position on the local police force. The detective conducting the interview looked at the three of them and said, \"So you all want to be a cop, eh?\"The blondes all nodded. The detective got up, opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder. Sitting back down, he opened it up and withdrew a photograph, and said, \"To be a detect, you have to be able to DETECT. You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.\" So saying, he stuck the photo in the face of the first blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. \"Now, he said, \"Did you notice any distinguishing features about this man?\"The blonde immediately said, \"Yes, I did. He only has one eye!\"The detective shook his head and said, \"Of COURSE he only has one eye in this picture! It''s a PROFILE of his face!

The detective then turned to the second blonde, stuck the photo in her face for two seconds, pulled it back and said, \"What about you? Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?\"The blonde immediately shot back, \"Yep! He only has one ear!\"The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, \"Didn''t you hear what I just said to the other lady? This is a PROFILE of the man''s face! Of COURSE you can only see one ear!! You''re excused, too!

Along comes the Game Warden in his boat, pulls up alongside the woman''s boat and asks her what she''s doing? She says, \"Reading my book.\" The Game Warden tells her she is in a restricted fishing area and she explains that she''s not fishing. To which he replied, \"But you have all this equipment. I will have to take you in and write you up!\" Angry that the warden was being so unreasonable, the lady told the warden, \"If you do that, I will charge you with rape.\" The warden, shocked by her statement, replied, \"But I didn''t even touch you.\" To which the lady replied, \"Yeah, but you have all the equipment!\"",

            "Several centuries ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave the Vatican. Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community. So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them. Rabbi Moishe''s Latin wasn''t very good - in fact, he knew very little--but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community. The pope agreed. What could be easier than a silent debate? \n\nThe day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.\" \n\nAn hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. The Pope said: \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\" \"And then?\" asked a woman. \"I don''t know,\" said Moishe. \"He took out his lunch and I took out mine.\"",
            "About a century or two ago, the Pope challenged the Jewish community of Rome to a debate.\n\nThe Jews looked around for a champion who could defend their faith, but no one wanted to volunteer. It was too risky. So they finally picked an old man named Moishe who spent his life sweeping up after people to represent them. Being old and poor, he had less to lose, so he agreed. He asked only for one addition to the rules of debate. Not being used to saying very much, he asked that neither side be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed.\n\nThe day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple.

I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews.

There was only one problem: The captain''s parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood he started shouting in the middle of the show: \"Look, it''s not the same hat\" \"Look, he is hiding the flowers under the table\" \"Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades ?\" The magician was furious but couldn''t do anything; it was, after all, the captain''s parrot. One day the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean with the parrot, of course. They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word. This went on for a day and then another and another. After a week the parrot said: \"OK, I give up. Where''s the boat?\"",

Rather than asking him about this, the Captain stood at the back of the room and listened to Jones'' sales pitch. Jones explained the basics of GI Insurance to the new recruits, and then said, \"If you are killed in a battle and have a GI Insurance, the government has to pay $200,000 to your beneficiaries.

Soon after there  was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to  see a big black bear.       The black bear said, \"That was a very bad mistake.  That was my cousin. I''m going to give you two choices.  Either I maul you to death or we have sex.\"     After considering briefly, Bob decided to accept the latter alternative.  So the black bear had his way with  Bob. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Bob soon recovered and vowed revenge.  He headed out on another trip to Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead.  Right after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him.    The grizzly said, \"That was a big mistake, Bob.  That was my cousin and you''ve got two choices: Either I maul you to death or I have sex with you.\" Again, Bob thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death.  So the grizzly had his way with Bob.      Although he survived, it took several months before Bob fully recovered.  Now Bob was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shoot it.  He felt sweet revenge, but then, moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder.  He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there.

He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain. As it was still early, she decided to go to the party. Since her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun watching him to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice woman he could, copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him. As a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had sex. Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away, went home, put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior. She was sitting up reading when he came in and she asked how the party was. He said, \"Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you''re not there.\" Then she asked, \"Did you dance much?\" He replied, \"I''ll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I''ll tell you... the guy I loaned my costume to sure had a really good time!\"",
            "Halloween Party\nA couple was invited to a masked Halloween Party. She got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. \nThe wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and a little kiss here, a little kiss there and sometimes a little bit more. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive woman herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the neighbouring rooms and did something which she would only allow her husband to do. She was quite upset afterwards because her husband could not know that she was his wife. She slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behaviour. She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, \"Oh, you know I never have a good time when you are not there.\" Then she asked, \"Did you dance much?\" He replied, \"I did not dance at all. When I got there I met Pete, Bill, John and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But the chap I lent my costume told me that he had a glorious evening.\""

Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.\n When he looked at the sky, he couldn''t tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.\n Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, \"Is the coming winter going to be cold?\"\n \"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,\" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.\n A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. \"Is it going to be a very cold winter?\"\n \"Yes,\" the man at National Weather Service again replied,\"it''s definitely going to be a very cold winter.\" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.\n Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. \"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?\"\n \"Absolutely,\" the man replied. \"It''s going to be one of the coldest winters ever.\"\n \"How can you be so sure?\" the Chief asked.\n The weatherman replied, \"The Indians are collecting wood like crazy.\"",

            "About a century or two ago, the Pope challenged the Jewish community of Rome to a debate.\n\nThe Jews looked around for a champion who could defend their faith, but no one wanted to volunteer. It was too risky. So they finally picked an old man named Moishe who spent his life sweeping up after people to represent them. Being old and poor, he had less to lose, so he agreed. He asked only for one addition to the rules of debate. Not being used to saying very much, he asked that neither side be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed.\n\nThe day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews win.\"\n\nAn hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger, to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him, that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground, showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe, amazed that this old, almost feeble-minded man had done what all their scholars had insisted was impossible. \"What happened?\" they asked.\n\n\"Well,\" said Moishe, \"first he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked a woman.\n\n\"I don''t know,\" said Moishe. \"He took out his lunch and I took out mine.\"",

            "The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I''m really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed! I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn''t notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, \"Jesus Christ!\" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, \"GO JESUS CHRIST, GO!\" Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn''t hear him very well, but it sounded like, \"Mother trucker,\" or \"Mother''s from there.\" Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.",

            "Here are Biblical bloopers from Sunday school students:\n\nFROM THE OLD TESTAMENT\n\nIn the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, the Lord got tired of\ncreating the world, so he took the Sabbath off.\n\n\nAdam & Eve were created from an apple tree.\n\n\nNoah''s wife was called Joan of Ark.\n\n\nNoah built the ark and the animals came on in pears.\n\n\nLot''s wife was a pillar of salt by day, but a ball of fire by night.\n\n\nThe Jews were a proud people and throughout history they had\ntrouble with unsympathetic Genitals.\n\n\nSampson was a strongman who let himself be led astray by a\njezebel like Delilah.\n\n\nSampson slated the Philistines with the axe of apostles.\n\n\nMoses led the Hebrews to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened\nbread, which is bread made without any ingredients.\n\n\nMoses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the Ten Amendments.\n\n\nThe first commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple.\n\n\nThe Fifth Commandment is humor thy mother and father.\n\n\nThe Seventh Commandment is thou shalt not admit adultery.\n\n\nMoses died before he ever reached the UK. Then Joshua led the\nHebrews in the Battle of Geritol.\n\n\nThe greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son to\nstand still and he obeyed him\n\n\nDavid was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with\nthe Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in the biblical times.\n\n\nSolomon, one of David''s sons, has 300 wives and 700 porcupines.\n\n\n\nFROM THE NEW TESTAMENT\n\n\nWhen the three wise guys from the East Side arrived, they found\nJesus- in the manager. Jesus was born because Mary had an\nemaculate contraption.\n\n\nSt. John, the Blacksmith, dumped water on his head.\n\n\nJesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others\nbefore - they do one to you. He also explained, \"Man doth not live by\nsweat alone.\"\n\n\nIt was a miracle when Jesus rose from the dead and managed to\nget the tombstone off the entrance.\n\n\nThe people who followed the Lord were called the 12 decibels.\n\n\nA Christian should have only one wife. This is called monotony.\n\n\nThe epistles were the wives of the apostles.\n\n\nOne of the opossums was St. Matthew, who was by profession a\ntaximan.\n\n\nWhen Mary heard that she was the Mother of Jesus, she sang the\nMagna Carta.\n\n\nSt. Paul cavorted to Christianity. He preached holy acrimony, which\nis another name for marriage.",
